00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:06.105
The exercise asked you to consider two projects

00:00:06.105 --> 00:00:12.025
in three areas of concern that might lead to each of the projects failing.

00:00:12.025 --> 00:00:16.380
Project 1 considered marketing message optimization.

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:20.100
Areas of concern for project one are as follows.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.315
The project is complex from a software and automation standpoint.

00:00:24.315 --> 00:00:28.290
It will require randomized deployment to parallel campaigns,

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.115
as well as subsequent measurement of these campaigns.

00:00:32.115 --> 00:00:36.280
This will require collaboration across several areas of the business.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.480
There could also be qualitative impact on the brand,

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.180
if messages are very distinct from each other.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.790
You must test only very minor surface level message alternatives

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.750
that still remain consistent with the brand.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.910
Finally, attribution may be a challenge if you

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.060
cannot link purchases to the marketing messages received.

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.905
Project 2 considered marketing segmentation.

00:01:00.905 --> 00:01:04.700
Areas of concern for this project are as follows.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:10.355
If the extensive customer data needed for this project exists in different silos,

00:01:10.355 --> 00:01:15.200
it may not be able to be integrated or reconciled for this project.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.160
Segmentation projects can take a bit longer to realize value,

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.950
since the initial data science work of creating

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.345
segments must be followed by some action based on that work,

00:01:26.345 --> 00:01:29.665
such as targeting segments for marketing messages.

00:01:29.665 --> 00:01:32.480
Executive leadership is excited about this,

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:37.840
but may lose patience if it takes too long for the project to deliver results.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.000
Results may also be quite different from

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.430
the accepted archetypes that had been

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.490
developed by the marketing department to this point.

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.030
This could see discontent and detraction from the marketing department,

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.890
one of the sets of stakeholder's key to the success of this project.
