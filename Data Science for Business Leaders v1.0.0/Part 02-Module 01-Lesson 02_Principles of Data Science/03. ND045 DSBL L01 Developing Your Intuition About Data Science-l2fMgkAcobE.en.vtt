00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:04.080
As a field, data science shares

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.965
many characteristics with other technical and engineering disciplines.

00:00:08.965 --> 00:00:13.155
That said, identifying data science opportunities,

00:00:13.155 --> 00:00:15.660
managing data science projects,

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.200
and building the human capital and infrastructure necessary to

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.275
support data science is unique in many respects.

00:00:23.275 --> 00:00:27.870
Part of our challenge in this course will be to understand the unique aspects of building

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.090
data science initiatives and how they

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.105
differ from other technical and business initiatives,

00:00:33.105 --> 00:00:36.610
typically implemented within an organization.
