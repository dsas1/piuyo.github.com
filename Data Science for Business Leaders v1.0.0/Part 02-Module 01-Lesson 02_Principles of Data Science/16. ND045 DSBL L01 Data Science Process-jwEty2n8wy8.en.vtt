00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:03.524
Later in the course,

00:00:03.524 --> 00:00:09.435
we will dive deep into the process of managing data science projects and initiatives.

00:00:09.435 --> 00:00:11.985
For now however, I would like to introduce

00:00:11.985 --> 00:00:16.200
eight steps that are typically involved in that process.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:22.515
First, you must identify the data science opportunity and determine success criteria,

00:00:22.515 --> 00:00:26.250
such as key performance indicators or KPIs.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.950
Second, you need to obtain the data required for the data science project.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:37.020
This may require building ETL or extract, transform,

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.820
and load pipelines and processes to bring

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.850
the data from different sources together to be available for a data science model.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.045
Third, you need to explore, understand,

00:00:50.045 --> 00:00:54.245
and prepare that data to use in a modeling context.

00:00:54.245 --> 00:00:57.050
Fourth, you need to identify

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.929
methodological approaches that will be considered in the data science process.

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:05.580
Fifth, you need to partition your data.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.180
Data science models usually require your data to be split into a training set,

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.960
a subset of your data that you used to train a machine learning model,

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.880
and a test set,

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.930
a smaller subset that's held out from training,

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.275
so it can be used to evaluate your machine learning model.

00:01:24.275 --> 00:01:31.630
Sixth, you need to build and evaluate models based on the aim of your project.

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:37.895
Seventh, once you have selected the model best suited for your use,

00:01:37.895 --> 00:01:41.289
you need to deploy that model in production.

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:47.675
Finally, eighth, models in production need continued attention through maintenance.

00:01:47.675 --> 00:01:51.590
Steps such as model retraining and model rollback

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.490
and redeploy make up the process of model maintenance.
