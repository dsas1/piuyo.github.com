00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:07.740
Today, nearly everybody's life is affected in one way or another by data science.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.965
From self-driving cars to smart phones,

00:00:10.965 --> 00:00:14.760
from product recommendations to automated customer service,

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:20.385
from automated medical diagnosis to predictive medical care, data science,

00:00:20.385 --> 00:00:23.295
machine learning and artificial intelligence

00:00:23.295 --> 00:00:26.775
are present in nearly every aspect of modern life.

00:00:26.775 --> 00:00:31.695
Businesses clearly have much to gain by pursuing data science initiatives.

00:00:31.695 --> 00:00:35.565
You might remember the course outline from the introduction lesson.

00:00:35.565 --> 00:00:38.460
It's important that we build a solid foundation

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.800
before diving more deeply into the later topics.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:47.150
This lesson lays the groundwork for the data science for business leaders course.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.085
We discussed data science,

00:00:49.085 --> 00:00:51.155
what it is and what it isn't.

00:00:51.155 --> 00:00:54.170
The goal of this first lesson is to introduce

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.290
you to the many flavors of data science methods,

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.900
aspects of the data science process,

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.360
and some basic foundational requirements for

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.525
success and risk factors that might lead to failure.

00:01:05.525 --> 00:01:08.990
This knowledge will serve as a foundation as we proceed to

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.890
learn about executing data science initiatives in the course.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.320
Upon completion of lesson one,

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.790
you should be able to successfully carry out the following tasks.

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.705
Classified data science projects in terms of area,

00:01:23.705 --> 00:01:26.420
approach and type of model.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.050
For a given area approach and model type,

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.570
provide one example project from your business.

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.505
Given the particulars of a data science project,

00:01:37.505 --> 00:01:42.355
identify areas of concern that might lead to the project failing.

00:01:42.355 --> 00:01:45.770
Given the particulars of a data science project,

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:51.300
identify steps that could be taken to help ensure the project succeeds.
