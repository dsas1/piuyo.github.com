00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:04.710
Lest we focus too much on failure,

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:05.940
I'd like to outline

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.010
a few key foundational requirements for a successful data science initiative.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.755
The first of these is deep intuition and knowledge of the business and problem context.

00:00:16.755 --> 00:00:19.020
Data science requires a marriage of

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.860
technical knowledge about the possible applications of data science,

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:28.020
and deep knowledge of the business context of the problem you're trying to address.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.485
Initiating data science projects with a lack of

00:00:31.485 --> 00:00:35.190
either one of these is going to lead to risks of trouble.

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.240
Your problem context must drive your decisions about model development.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.270
In practice, I often see this play out in the other direction.

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.550
Over time, machine learning specialists

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.650
naturally develop affinities for certain approaches.

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.225
As expertise in a given algorithmic family grows,

00:00:53.225 --> 00:00:57.470
it's tempting to fit problems to a favored algorithmic approach

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.780
as opposed to matching an algorithmic approach to whatever the problem may require.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.500
Contextual knowledge helps prioritize the timing of projects as well.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.090
Areas likely to benefit from data science tend to be

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.940
good initial projects as quick wins can

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.945
help foster stake holder enthusiasm and generate momentum.

00:01:17.945 --> 00:01:21.140
Second, data science initiatives that are

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.725
successful require relevant and high quality data.

00:01:24.725 --> 00:01:27.530
There's no getting around the fact that data quality is

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.555
a necessary but not sufficient condition for data science success.

00:01:32.555 --> 00:01:35.345
You can have world class machine learning experts

00:01:35.345 --> 00:01:37.789
able to implement state of the art models,

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:41.930
but if you do not have quality data that's relevant for your problem context,

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.845
you're not likely to see success out of your data science project.

00:01:45.845 --> 00:01:50.480
Third, you must have a versatile computational toolbox.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:55.895
Your data science experts must be able to implement high quality data pre-processing,

00:01:55.895 --> 00:02:01.879
generate informative data visualizations to explain the model to non-technical experts,

00:02:01.879 --> 00:02:06.410
and apply the appropriate modeling tools for the context at hand.

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.220
Your toolbox must be appropriately used as well.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.170
Even if you have a great model,

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.435
if you over fit the data to that model,

00:02:14.435 --> 00:02:19.530
the results will not generalize to cases likely to be encountered in production.
