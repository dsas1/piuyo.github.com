00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:05.280
One of my main objectives in teaching this course is to

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.879
set you up for success in your own data science initiatives.

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:14.190
As such, I'd like to share several of the things that I've noticed during my career that

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.560
represent red flag warnings that

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.445
suggest the potential of failure of data science projects.

00:00:20.445 --> 00:00:25.975
I have 13 reasons that data science projects fail that I detail in my book.

00:00:25.975 --> 00:00:28.550
These are as follows.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.720
One, the data science initiative is not aligned with

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.180
the business' strategic objectives and

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.515
therefore fails to address a critical business need.

00:00:38.515 --> 00:00:41.870
Two, groups and people in the organization

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.965
failed the collaborate well enough around the data science project.

00:00:45.965 --> 00:00:52.870
Three, the data science initiative didn't produce the results expected by the business.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.930
Four, the data science initiative failed to maintain

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.030
sufficient support and buy-in from the executive leaders in the business.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:08.915
Five, expectations were set too high and the resulting product did not measure up.

00:01:08.915 --> 00:01:11.960
Six, the idea behind

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.509
the data science project is flawed and simply will not work as designed.

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:19.520
Seven, the idea is great,

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.870
but there's not enough information or variation in the data for data science or

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:29.455
machine learning to detect a robust signal and provide the intended results.

00:01:29.455 --> 00:01:35.430
Eight, governance rules restrict the data and uses of the data.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:43.040
Nine, the data exists in different silos and cannot be integrated or reconciled.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.985
Ten, the data was not well understood

00:01:46.985 --> 00:01:51.250
and could not be used as expected for the data science initiative.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.770
Eleven, the machine learning training set was insufficient.

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.280
Twelve, insufficient resources, people,

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.520
hardware, and software were allocated to the project.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.025
Finally, thirteen, the culture of the business

00:02:10.025 --> 00:02:14.490
is not accepting of data science and digital transformation.
