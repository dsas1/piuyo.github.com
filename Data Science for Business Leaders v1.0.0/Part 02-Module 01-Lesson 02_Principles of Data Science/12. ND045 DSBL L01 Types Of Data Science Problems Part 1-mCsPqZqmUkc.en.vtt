00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:06.300
Now that you have a familiarity with different approaches to data science,

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.020
it's time to learn about the different types of data science problems.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.380
Data science problems can come in a variety of forms.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.220
In this section, we will discuss the major categories of

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.835
data science methods you're likely to encounter in your data science journey.

00:00:21.835 --> 00:00:26.840
Perhaps the most common among these is supervised learning.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.600
This target a designated outcome,

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.909
whether it be a numerical value,

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:35.600
such as a customer's annual spend, or a category,

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.940
such as the likelihood that a customer will

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.149
cancel their subscription to a company service.

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:45.125
With supervised learning, the main goal is usually prediction.

00:00:45.125 --> 00:00:47.615
How can I predict, for example,

00:00:47.615 --> 00:00:53.585
a customer lifetime value or assign a credit score or forecast revenues and profits?

00:00:53.585 --> 00:01:00.319
These examples predict against a numerical outcome and are known as regression problems.

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:03.245
The other type of supervised learning problem

00:01:03.245 --> 00:01:06.230
focuses on predicting a categorical outcome.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.415
These are known as classification problems.

00:01:09.415 --> 00:01:12.630
Examples of classification problems include

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.890
predicting failure in a manufacturing context,

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.994
predicting whether a machine will be hacked,

00:01:18.994 --> 00:01:22.985
identifying fraudulent online transactions,

00:01:22.985 --> 00:01:29.465
diagnosing medical conditions, and tagging e-mail in categories such as work,

00:01:29.465 --> 00:01:32.945
friends, family, hobby, and news.

00:01:32.945 --> 00:01:37.459
Classification and regression tasks aim to understand an outcome,

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:42.630
which is the main thing that characterizes them as supervised learning methods.

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:48.910
One particularly powerful supervised learning approach is known as deep learning.

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:53.660
Deep learning uses an algorithmic approach called neural networks to

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.210
perform many classification tasks that are

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.105
commonly used in artificial intelligence today.

00:01:59.105 --> 00:02:04.190
Speech recognition, computer vision, facial recognition,

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.890
self-driving cars, and voice enabled

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.830
digital assistants all have their technical foundations in deep learning.

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.930
Entire courses are taught on deep learning alone.

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.970
But here we will treat it as one of many supervised learning methods in data science.
