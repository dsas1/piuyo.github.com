00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:03.840
Let's dive a little deeper.

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.180
For example, consider the following.

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.970
A digital telehealth startup receives messages of many kinds from its patients.

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:16.560
One patient may want a copy of last month's invoice.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.950
A second patient might want to know more

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:24.010
about switching from a daily formulation to a monthly formulation.

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:27.964
A third might report side effects such as headaches,

00:00:27.964 --> 00:00:32.135
dizziness, and arm numbness after starting a new medication.

00:00:32.135 --> 00:00:35.915
These messages clearly differ in their content.

00:00:35.915 --> 00:00:39.110
The first might be appropriate for customer support,

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.935
whereas the other two might need to go directly to a medical provider.

00:00:42.935 --> 00:00:45.665
Moreover, they differ in urgency.

00:00:45.665 --> 00:00:50.255
The third patient dealing with critical side effects of a new medication,

00:00:50.255 --> 00:00:53.585
clearly has a more urgent need than the second patient,

00:00:53.585 --> 00:00:59.390
who's merely curious about changing the frequency with which the medication is taken.

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.400
In the beginning, these messages might be handled by a single person

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.860
processing them in a queue and sending

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.115
them to either customer support or medical support.

00:01:10.115 --> 00:01:13.160
You might be able to see how this would become a problem for

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.985
both the users and the business as it scales and grows.

00:01:16.985 --> 00:01:20.090
This would quickly become unwieldy and

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.405
an automated process for classifying and rounding these messages might be desired.

00:01:25.405 --> 00:01:28.325
This would lead to better response times,

00:01:28.325 --> 00:01:32.615
better patient experience, and may even save someone's life.

00:01:32.615 --> 00:01:38.249
All of these are huge benefits to our business and most importantly, their customers.
