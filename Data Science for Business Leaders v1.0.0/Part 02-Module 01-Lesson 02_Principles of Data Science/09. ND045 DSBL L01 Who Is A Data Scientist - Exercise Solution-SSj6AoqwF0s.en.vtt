00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:05.760
Data scientists can come from a variety of backgrounds with

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:11.160
educational experiences that span both technical and non-technical disciplines.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.610
For this exercise, you were asked to provide

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.240
one core strength likely to aid in data science work,

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.570
and at least one area that might need additional exposure or

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.240
training for students with different academic backgrounds.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.085
Computer scientists have deep strengths in coding.

00:00:30.085 --> 00:00:33.725
They may need more exposure to statistical methodology,

00:00:33.725 --> 00:00:37.565
especially machine learning, quantitative reasoning,

00:00:37.565 --> 00:00:40.675
and business strategy and concepts.

00:00:40.675 --> 00:00:43.590
Statisticians have deep strengths in

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.925
statistical methodology, especially machine learning.

00:00:46.925 --> 00:00:52.680
They may need more exposure with coding and business strategy and concepts.

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.410
Mathematicians have strengths in quantitative reasoning.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.320
They may need a little more exposure in coding,

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.840
the specifics of statistical methodology,

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.715
and especially machine learning,

00:01:04.715 --> 00:01:07.795
and business strategy and concepts.

00:01:07.795 --> 00:01:12.890
Engineers tend to be strong in coding and quantitative reasoning.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.520
They may need a little more work with statistical methodology,

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.710
as well as business strategy and concepts.

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.450
Graduates of business administration programs

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.600
have deep strength in business strategy and concepts.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.185
They may need exposure to statistical methodology,

00:01:30.185 --> 00:01:33.600
coding, and quantitative reasoning.

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:39.920
Physicists typically have deep strengths in coding and quantitative reasoning.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.740
They may need more specialized exposure to

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.790
statistical methodology and the specifics of machine learning,

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.870
as well as introduction to business strategy and concepts.

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.745
Finally, economists have key strengths in business strategy and concepts,

00:01:57.745 --> 00:02:00.740
and typically have strong quantitative reasoning

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.265
and basic statistical methodologies skills as well.

00:02:04.265 --> 00:02:07.280
They may need a little more exposure to coding,

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.800
as well as advanced statistical methodology,

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.260
and in particular, machine learning.
