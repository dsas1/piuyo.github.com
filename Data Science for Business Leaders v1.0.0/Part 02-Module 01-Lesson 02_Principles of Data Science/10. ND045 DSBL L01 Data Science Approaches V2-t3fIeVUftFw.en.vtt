00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
We have established what data science is and who data scientists are,

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.690
but how should we approach data science?

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.305
There are three general approaches to data science problems,

00:00:10.305 --> 00:00:15.870
these include descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive approaches.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.330
As the name suggests,

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.180
descriptive data science problems require statistical analysis to identify,

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.305
summarize, and describe a phenomenon of interest.

00:00:26.305 --> 00:00:29.840
Common descriptive problems include customer segmentation,

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.030
and business process dash-boarding.

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.640
Predictive approaches attempt to predict

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.975
a categorical or numerical outcome given a collection of inputs.

00:00:38.975 --> 00:00:44.930
For example, it's common for B2C businesses to use predictive models to

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:51.625
identify people likely to churn or discontinue using a business' products or service.

00:00:51.625 --> 00:00:55.985
Prescriptive approaches build on descriptive and predictive models

00:00:55.985 --> 00:01:00.215
with a bias towards identifying optimal actions over simply monitoring.

00:01:00.215 --> 00:01:05.540
For example, some forms of automated marketing message testing will

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.120
incorporate micro experiments comparing

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.539
slight differences in text using marketing messages,

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:17.335
and will automatically optimize messages to be sent to individual customers.

00:01:17.335 --> 00:01:21.199
The goal of segmentation is to identify

00:01:21.199 --> 00:01:24.845
groups of customers based on similar characteristics.

00:01:24.845 --> 00:01:27.560
We use the data we have on customers to

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.875
describe those groups based on their buying behavior.

00:01:30.875 --> 00:01:33.650
These descriptions can be very valuable,

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.010
as they allow a business to target their marketing outreach

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.425
based on characteristics particular to individual segments.

00:01:41.425 --> 00:01:46.430
The idea for predicting customer churn is to predict customers that are

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.980
likely to leave the company or discontinue using the company's products or services.

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.950
Predictive models can identify triggers that

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.040
ultimately identify customers likely to churn.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.585
Armed with that knowledge,

00:01:59.585 --> 00:02:02.465
marketers can employ preventative actions,

00:02:02.465 --> 00:02:04.969
such as targeting outreach that increases

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:08.060
the likelihood that a customer will be retained by the business.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.580
In other words, that the customer will not churn.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.015
In the case of marketing message optimization,

00:02:16.015 --> 00:02:19.010
the idea is that we have several different ways to

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.645
craft the content of marketing outreach messages,

00:02:22.645 --> 00:02:27.515
and we would like a way to identify which of those formulations is optimal.

00:02:27.515 --> 00:02:32.119
Typically, this is done through AB testing of alternative messages.

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:36.860
A prescriptive analytics approach automates this AB testing by sending out

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.875
slightly differing alternatives to different customer micro-segments.

00:02:41.875 --> 00:02:44.360
The results of these messages,

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.870
whether they lead to customer acquisition, for example,

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.915
are monitored, and a prescriptive solution will

00:02:50.915 --> 00:02:55.380
automatically optimize toward the best-performing content.
