00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:03.285
You may not believe it,

00:00:03.285 --> 00:00:06.370
but we're already at the end of this lesson.

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:08.540
Great job so far.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.440
Let's recap what we've covered.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.100
We've undertaken a broad overview of

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.220
the landscape of data science methods and approaches.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.975
We've also talked about risk factors for the failure of data science initiatives,

00:00:21.975 --> 00:00:25.995
as well as foundational requirements for data science success.

00:00:25.995 --> 00:00:31.075
Our next lesson, we will dive more deeply into the business case for data science.

00:00:31.075 --> 00:00:33.710
We will learn how to apply what we've learned so

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.990
far to specific opportunities for data science and business.

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:42.770
We'll also describe how to prioritize data science opportunities within

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:47.705
a business and create a roadmap for carrying out our new data science initiatives.

00:00:47.705 --> 00:00:51.180
I look forward to joining you in the next lesson.
