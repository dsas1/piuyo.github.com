00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:06.540
Thus far we have discussed one type of data science problem in particular,

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.820
those that require supervised learning.

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:16.095
A second class of data science methods is known as unsupervised learning.

00:00:16.095 --> 00:00:19.695
Unsupervised learning models exploit patterns in the data,

00:00:19.695 --> 00:00:23.775
but are not concerned about predicting towards a specific outcome.

00:00:23.775 --> 00:00:28.920
One of the most common families of unsupervised learning is clustering.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.510
The general task for clustering algorithms is to

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:37.024
identify groups of cases according to similarities in their variables.

00:00:37.024 --> 00:00:40.040
Clustering algorithms in use today provide

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.570
the algorithmic foundation of the Google PageRank algorithm,

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.235
classification of news items,

00:00:46.235 --> 00:00:49.955
gene expression in DNA microarrays,

00:00:49.955 --> 00:00:56.695
social network analysis, customer segmentation, and market segmentation.

00:00:56.695 --> 00:01:02.005
A second form of unsupervised learning is known as anomaly detection.

00:01:02.005 --> 00:01:04.280
The goal of anomaly detection,

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.915
as its name suggests,

00:01:05.915 --> 00:01:08.630
is to identify aberrant cases or

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:14.419
unusual cases based on the collection of variables that characterize those cases.

00:01:14.419 --> 00:01:19.940
Monitoring systems, such as those aim to detect fraud, phishing attacks,

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.414
breakdowns in a manufacturing process,

00:01:22.414 --> 00:01:28.355
or surges in network traffic often have their basis in anomaly detection methods.

00:01:28.355 --> 00:01:32.390
Finally, a more specialized technical type

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.765
of unsupervised learning is dimensionality reduction.

00:01:35.765 --> 00:01:40.285
We will not dive too deep into dimensionality reduction in this course,

00:01:40.285 --> 00:01:43.460
but it's good to be familiar with as a technique used in

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.730
machine learning modeling for reducing the complexity of

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.430
the set of features or variables that might

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.120
subsequently be used in a supervised learning context.
