00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:04.680
This exercise asked you to consider

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.050
two additional projects and the steps you'd

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.005
take to ensure that each of the projects would succeed.

00:00:10.005 --> 00:00:12.900
Project 3 considered customer churn.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.715
I'd recommend the following tale,

00:00:14.715 --> 00:00:16.920
facilitate success of the project.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.680
Churn prediction can have great benefits and

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.410
provide solid insight in a short amount of time.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.860
As such, it's generally a good candidate for early adoption in the roadmap.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:30.200
I would choose this project as one of the first completed in

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.925
order to generate momentum for data science in the business.

00:00:33.925 --> 00:00:36.285
Generalization is a key here,

00:00:36.285 --> 00:00:37.910
so I would make sure that we use

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.060
best practices to make sure we do not over fit the training

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:46.780
set at the expense of being able to predict churn on new customers.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.450
I would work closely with marketing specialists who know

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.840
the customer to make sure that the factors identified by

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.870
the model as associated with churn are truly

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.405
actionable and irrelevant in crafting retention strategies.

00:01:01.405 --> 00:01:05.929
Project 4 considered customer loyalty programs.

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:10.310
I'd recommend the following to help bring success to that project.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.710
Projects such as this require lots of data from disparate sources.

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.075
I would make sure the data exists,

00:01:17.075 --> 00:01:21.575
was of high-quality and could be integrated for machine learning use.

00:01:21.575 --> 00:01:25.205
I would start small with a few targeted offers.

00:01:25.205 --> 00:01:29.090
I'd measure and share initial results so that successes could generate

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.340
momentum for moving to more complex analyses and offers.

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.170
Finally, I would make sure to involve

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.710
marketing professionals in every step of the process.

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.450
Loyalty programs can become ineffective if they're implemented improperly.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.460
For example, if multiple competing offers are sent to customers,

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.395
or if customers are repeatedly spammed with offers.

00:01:53.395 --> 00:01:57.725
Before deploying any offers generated by data science models,

00:01:57.725 --> 00:02:01.850
I would make sure that marketing experts agreed that the offers made sense in

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.840
the larger context of the company's branding and marketing efforts.
