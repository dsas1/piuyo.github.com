00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:05.145
Data scientists can come from a variety of backgrounds,

00:00:05.145 --> 00:00:10.740
with educational experiences that span both technical and non-technical disciplines.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.290
Successful data scientists typically possess some mix of expertise in coding,

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:22.050
statistical methodology, communication, business strategy,

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.545
machine learning, and quantitative reasoning.

00:00:25.545 --> 00:00:29.700
As such, fields that require deep training in one or more of

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.705
these areas serve as common educational backgrounds for data scientists.

00:00:34.705 --> 00:00:39.620
In my own work building and leading data science practices and initiatives,

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:45.200
I've employed professionals with training in computer science, statistics, mathematics,

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:51.010
engineering, physics, economics, and psychology;

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:56.750
each of which requires deep skills in one or more of the key areas I mentioned before.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.655
This is not an exclusive list however.

00:00:59.655 --> 00:01:03.695
Even individuals who did not complete training in one of these areas

00:01:03.695 --> 00:01:07.835
can become a successful data scientist by picking up the skills elsewhere.

00:01:07.835 --> 00:01:12.080
In fact, one very successful team member of mine is

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.270
a classically trained musician who found an interest dabbling in software development,

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.940
which he eventually leveraged to become a self-taught data scientist.

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.810
Data science can bring tremendous benefits to a business.

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.740
Data science can aid and better decision-making,

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:36.365
empowering executives to act by giving better insight into potential outcomes.

00:01:36.365 --> 00:01:38.960
Data science can improve efficiency of

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.730
operations and help lower costs across the business.

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:47.000
Data science can enable better delivery of

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.810
a business' products and services to its customers.

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.400
Data science can help identify new opportunities for the business,

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.590
new products, services, and ways of providing support.

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.445
Data science can provide insight into the success of marketing campaigns,

00:02:04.445 --> 00:02:08.935
allowing more targeted efforts that bring a greater return on investment.

00:02:08.935 --> 00:02:15.245
Finally, data science can facilitate better personalization across customer experiences.

00:02:15.245 --> 00:02:19.745
Today, customers demand tailored experiences more than ever,

00:02:19.745 --> 00:02:25.535
and data science provides one set of tools to help businesses deliver on such demands.

00:02:25.535 --> 00:02:28.250
Now that you have a better understanding of the importance of

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.935
data science and who data scientists are,

00:02:30.935 --> 00:02:34.200
it's time to put your knowledge to a test.
