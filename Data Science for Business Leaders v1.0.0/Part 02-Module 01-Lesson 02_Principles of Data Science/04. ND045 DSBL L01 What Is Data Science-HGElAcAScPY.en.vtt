00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:04.980
Data science has garnered a great deal of hype.

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.950
But what exactly is data science?

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.780
Data science is a field of study that combines domain expertise,

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.960
programming skills, and knowledge of mathematics and

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.965
statistics to extract meaningful insights from data.

00:00:19.965 --> 00:00:25.560
For our purposes, we will consider the field of data science to include data analytics,

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.875
artificial intelligence, and machine learning.

00:00:28.875 --> 00:00:32.295
The first of these, data analytics,

00:00:32.295 --> 00:00:35.730
is the science of analyzing raw data in order to

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.745
drive business processes and improve business outcomes.

00:00:39.745 --> 00:00:43.850
Examples of data analytics projects include

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.625
creation of dashboards to track metrics critical to the company,

00:00:48.625 --> 00:00:54.865
forecasting sales or other operational outcomes to help align resources to needs,

00:00:54.865 --> 00:00:58.979
providing a 360 degree view of the customer,

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:04.145
and correlational analyses, such as when the degree of engagement increases,

00:01:04.145 --> 00:01:07.075
so does lifetime customer value.

00:01:07.075 --> 00:01:11.395
The second of these areas, artificial intelligence,

00:01:11.395 --> 00:01:14.780
represents a class of algorithms that direct machines in

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.320
activities that mimic the cognition and action of humans.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.410
Artificial intelligence has found a wide variety of uses in business.

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:29.920
Email spam filters have long served as an example of artificial intelligence.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.925
AI provides opportunities for personalization of the customer experience,

00:01:34.925 --> 00:01:39.125
and can predict customer service needs on aspects of the customer,

00:01:39.125 --> 00:01:44.285
and even on tone and content of customer interactions on support calls.

00:01:44.285 --> 00:01:47.360
Finally, in retail applications,

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.330
dynamic price optimization can provide a way for

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.595
real-time pricing based on changing customer and market trends.

00:01:55.595 --> 00:02:01.670
Finally, Machine learning, often considered a subset of artificial intelligence,

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:07.220
is a family of statistical approaches that use modern statistics to find patterns,

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.470
classify outcomes, and make predictions using massive amounts of data.

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.395
Examples of machine learning are bound in business.

00:02:16.395 --> 00:02:20.090
Traditional customer segmentation can be supported at

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.405
a much more granular level through machine learning based micro-segmentation.

00:02:25.405 --> 00:02:29.315
Online ad targeting can be supported with machine learning,

00:02:29.315 --> 00:02:32.565
especially to optimize the bidding process.

00:02:32.565 --> 00:02:35.630
Machine learning techniques form the basis for

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.755
recommending products on online retail sites,

00:02:38.755 --> 00:02:43.450
and can provide predictions of purchases and other customer behavior.

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.470
Finally, machine learning techniques can aid in pattern and image recognition,

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.520
which can be helpful in contexts varying as widely as identifying

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:58.110
manufacturing defects and recognizing new product and service opportunities.
