00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:07.540
This exercise asked you to classify a number of marketing data science projects,

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.165
in terms of the data science approach,

00:00:10.165 --> 00:00:12.350
descriptive, predictive or prescriptive,

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:17.695
and type of model such as supervised regression or classification,

00:00:17.695 --> 00:00:22.495
unsupervised clustering or anomaly detection,

00:00:22.495 --> 00:00:28.850
Natural Language Processing, recommender systems, or deep learning.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:34.210
Project one was a marketing message optimization project.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.529
The approach here does not include prediction or prescribing behavior,

00:00:38.529 --> 00:00:41.305
so it is a descriptive learning task.

00:00:41.305 --> 00:00:47.060
The type of model we typically use for this is an AB testing model.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.980
Project two is a marketing segmentation task.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.449
This project also has no predictive or prescriptive component.

00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:59.945
It too is a descriptive learning task.

00:00:59.945 --> 00:01:04.745
Marketing segmentation is typically carried out using clustering methods,

00:01:04.745 --> 00:01:08.790
which is an example of an unsupervised model.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.690
Project three had to do with understanding customer churn.

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:20.525
Here we want to predict whether a customer will leave the company's products or services,

00:01:20.525 --> 00:01:23.845
so the approach is one of predictive learning.

00:01:23.845 --> 00:01:26.540
We're predicting a binary outcome,

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.360
whether a customer is to churn or not.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.360
This is a classification exercise,

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.210
which is an example of a supervised model.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.105
Project four is a customer loyalty program.

00:01:41.105 --> 00:01:44.180
At the heart of this project is predicting whether

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.870
a customer will execute on a particular offer.

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:54.200
As such, this is a predictive learning problem with the target of the prediction being

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:00.710
the binary classification of execute versus not execute the offer.

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.045
Tasks such as these require classification algorithms,

00:02:05.045 --> 00:02:09.660
which again are examples of supervised models.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:16.630
Project five was a data science project having to do with customer loyalty assessment.

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.930
Here we were predicting a rating that customers would

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.680
give to reflect their experience with the business.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.225
As such, the data science approach is predictive learning.

00:02:28.225 --> 00:02:32.605
Since we are predicting a numerical rating and not a category,

00:02:32.605 --> 00:02:36.980
we will use a form of supervised regression model.

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:46.510
Finally, projects six was a data science project that assessed customer attitudes.

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.580
There was no prediction or prescribed behavior associated with this project.

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.325
It is an example of descriptive learning.

00:02:55.325 --> 00:03:00.380
The project required understanding postings from social media and

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.350
natural language processing task that in

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:08.220
this case will require sentiment analysis methods.
