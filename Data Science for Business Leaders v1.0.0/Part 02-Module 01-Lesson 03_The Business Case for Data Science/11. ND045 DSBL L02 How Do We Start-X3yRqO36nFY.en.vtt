00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:05.760
Now that we have identified our first data science project that we will

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.930
undertake to launch our data science initiative, how do we begin?

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.900
I have four steps that I follow when I'm

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.010
specifying the details that will make up a data science project.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.010
First, it is imperative to understand

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.355
the current state of whatever problem you're trying to solve.

00:00:23.355 --> 00:00:28.590
If you are trying to develop a customer segmentation strategy based on data science,

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.045
what is currently done by the business in the area of customer segmentation?

00:00:33.045 --> 00:00:35.340
What are the strengths of that approach?

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.025
What aspects must remain the same?

00:00:38.025 --> 00:00:40.960
Where does that approach fall short?

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.040
Understanding the current state will help you with the second step,

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.650
re-imagining opportunities that come about

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.680
when data science is incorporated into the process.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.870
In our segmentation example,

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.230
what benefits would a data science-based approach bring?

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.620
Is it able to handle greater complexity?

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.800
Is it able to scale in ways that the previous process could not?

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.740
In this case, we're re-imagining how we execute on

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:15.140
strategic objectives of the company with the help of data science.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.170
At this point, we're ready to put together

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.900
the business case for the data science project.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.294
Once we understand opportunities afforded to us through data science,

00:01:25.294 --> 00:01:27.530
how can we articulate the benefits of

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.930
a data science-based approach and

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.240
the additional return on investment that we would get via the data science path?

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.790
The business case speaks to the strategic objectives of

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.240
the company in a way that's particularly appealing to

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.240
leaders and executives who need to consider

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.575
the opportunity costs of any potential project.

00:01:48.575 --> 00:01:52.520
Finally, when we arrive at the execution phase,

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.560
we want to undertake the development of

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.475
the data science project using a rapid prototyping approach.

00:01:58.475 --> 00:02:04.160
Rapid prototyping is an iterative approach wherein we get user feedback often and do

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.020
not allow ourselves to go very far

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.085
afield without putting our model in front of potential users.

00:02:10.085 --> 00:02:12.980
I have a few examples from early in my career when I

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.845
did not adopt a rapid prototyping approach.

00:02:15.845 --> 00:02:20.825
The key point involved here is that without regular feedback from users,

00:02:20.825 --> 00:02:25.430
the data science project may end up solving a problem other than the one most critical

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.860
to users or may include features that are

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.130
irrelevant or even counter to the aims of the model.
