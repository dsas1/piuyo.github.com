00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:06.225
Once you have identified a portfolio of candidate data science projects,

00:00:06.225 --> 00:00:08.700
you must determine a relative priority for

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.195
various projects which will inform the order in which they are implemented.

00:00:13.195 --> 00:00:15.515
To support this exercise,

00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:20.850
I first rate all the projects on several dimensions that together make up feasibility,

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.200
impact, and likelihood of value capture.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:30.140
For example, let's say I have a number of projects that I'm considering for inclusion on

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.500
a data science roadmap and I'd like to assess each of

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.260
them on various aspects that reflect their potential on the roadmap.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.080
Let's say the first of these is a propensity model that

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.610
predicts a customer's likelihood of responding to a marketing offer.

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.960
Customer purchase behavior is directly aligned with most companies

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.975
strategic goals so we would rate this high in that regard.

00:00:54.975 --> 00:00:58.280
Typical propensity models use data that is already gathered

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.340
by the business and often this data exists in

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.930
one or only a few different sources so the cost of this project will

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.165
likely be low and the complexity of implementing this project will likely be low as well.

00:01:11.165 --> 00:01:14.945
Propensity modeling is one of the more promising areas of marketing.

00:01:14.945 --> 00:01:19.415
It tends to deliver pretty regularly with relatively large benefits,

00:01:19.415 --> 00:01:22.384
with little risk associated with such projects.

00:01:22.384 --> 00:01:25.340
As such, we would rate this project as having

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:31.930
relatively high certainty of value capture and a relatively large magnitude of benefit.

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.055
Let's consider our second project now.

00:01:35.055 --> 00:01:40.670
Let's say the business has challenges with backlogs in responding to customer requests.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.775
Customers often email or text the company with service questions

00:01:44.775 --> 00:01:49.295
but it takes a long time for a human to respond appropriately to those questions.

00:01:49.295 --> 00:01:54.530
The company would like to look into developing a customer service chatbot that uses

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.280
natural language processing to automatically assess the need

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.480
represented by each message and respond to that need automatically.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.605
How might we rate the customer service chatbot project?

00:02:06.605 --> 00:02:09.890
First, customer service is certainly aligned

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.115
with strategic goals so we would rate that as high.

00:02:13.115 --> 00:02:17.405
The cost of delivering a chatbot would be pretty extensive however,

00:02:17.405 --> 00:02:21.500
it would take quite a lot of research in tuning to understand categories of

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.630
customer needs and develop the right responses to be provided automatically.

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.935
As such, we would rate the costs of this project as high.

00:02:30.935 --> 00:02:32.825
By the same token,

00:02:32.825 --> 00:02:36.470
complexity of implementing a system of this kind would be pretty

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.360
substantial so we would rate complexity as high as well.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.160
Chatbots must be customized to a companies customer needs.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.030
Developing the right responses can be a speculative exercise

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.520
so the certainty of value capture here would be relatively low as well.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.885
If the company were able to pull it off,

00:02:56.885 --> 00:02:58.760
the benefit would be substantial.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.820
The company would increase customer satisfaction through

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:07.190
much quicker response times and could do so with lower payroll impact.

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.700
Once I've rated all the projects under consideration,

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.480
I represent the projects in a visual format that allows me to take into

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.299
consideration the project's relative attractiveness in a number of terms.

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:24.340
Here, I consolidate my ratings into three separate components.

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.950
First, I consider the feasibility of the project.

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.960
This is a combination of the time required to develop and carry out the project,

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.869
the costs associated with the project,

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:38.350
and the complexity of the project.

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.080
Second, I consider the potential business value

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.690
that the project will bring if successful.

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.465
Third, I consider the likelihood that the project will be successful.

00:03:49.465 --> 00:03:52.730
Are there any risks that would stand in the way of the project

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.000
delivering the value we expect to see from it?

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.280
To what degree is there certainty or

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.780
uncertainty around the project's ability to deliver on its promise?
