00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:07.680
As we discussed during this lesson when prioritizing data science projects for a roadmap,

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.235
those projects should be assessed in terms of feasibility,

00:00:11.235 --> 00:00:14.865
potential impact, and likelihood of value capture.

00:00:14.865 --> 00:00:17.480
It can be tempting to choose the project with

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.665
the greatest feasibility and greatest potential impact as a first project.

00:00:21.665 --> 00:00:23.990
Here, that would be project 5.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.380
Sometimes simply choosing the project furthest up into

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.040
the right might not represent the best choice of a first project.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.950
However, a leader faced with deciding among projects might

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:43.130
wisely choose to launch a roadmap with a project with lesser potential benefit if,

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.410
in fact, that project has greater certainty of delivering.

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.170
This is especially critical in the initial stages of

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.925
data science adoption in order to develop and maintain enthusiasm,

00:00:55.925 --> 00:01:01.660
momentum, and continued investment in data science from the business.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.520
In this case, I'd likely choose project 1 as

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.470
the first project as the likelihood of success is much greater.

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.290
Risk of failure is especially critical

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.560
during the initial months of your data science initiative.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:21.019
Choosing a launch project that will almost certainly deliver and do so relatively

00:01:21.019 --> 00:01:24.290
quickly can be the most important consideration

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.570
when filling out the data science roadmap.
