00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:03.685
Welcome to our next lesson,

00:00:03.685 --> 00:00:06.790
the business case for data science.

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:09.580
In this lesson, we train our focus on

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:14.495
the business context within which data science initiatives may be implemented.

00:00:14.495 --> 00:00:18.610
Creating a data science strategy is not a standalone activity.

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:23.900
It must be driven by your overarching business operations and strategy.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.920
A critical starting point for any data strategy is articulation of a businesses

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.680
strategic objectives and identification

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.130
of opportunities for data science based transformation.

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.310
This lesson discusses how a leader may specify

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.665
the data science projects that can help achieve the company's business strategy.

00:00:43.665 --> 00:00:47.435
How a data science project may drive value for the business,

00:00:47.435 --> 00:00:51.665
and how the data for those initiatives can be creatively sourced.

00:00:51.665 --> 00:00:56.225
Applying a hypothesis led approach to various data science use cases,

00:00:56.225 --> 00:00:59.825
you will become familiar with evaluating whether

00:00:59.825 --> 00:01:04.045
a given business opportunity might benefit from data science approaches,

00:01:04.045 --> 00:01:07.430
racking and stacking potential opportunities across

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.609
the business to prioritize and identify the optimal places to start,

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:17.360
and actually designing data science projects to

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.525
predict and optimize outcomes towards capitalizing on business opportunities.

00:01:22.525 --> 00:01:25.145
Upon completion of this lesson,

00:01:25.145 --> 00:01:29.200
you will be able to successfully carry out the following tasks.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.660
Define an organization's data science roadmap.

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.780
Here we'll identify the best projects to start with and

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.920
detailed strategies for successfully launching data science initiatives.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.895
Second, we'll be able to determine a starting point.

00:01:43.895 --> 00:01:46.760
The most appropriate first project or suite of

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.360
projects to capture the most promising opportunities and

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.480
launch the data science function with adequate momentum to

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.725
ensure its long-term operation within the organization.

00:01:57.725 --> 00:02:02.240
Third, you'll be able to work with fellow executives to set and

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.775
manage reasonable expectations of success for data science projects.

00:02:06.775 --> 00:02:11.435
Fourth, given a set of candidate data science projects,

00:02:11.435 --> 00:02:15.500
you'll determine the relative strategic importance, cost,

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.710
complexity of implementation, risk,

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.765
likelihood of value capture,

00:02:20.765 --> 00:02:24.575
and magnitude of benefit for each of the projects.

00:02:24.575 --> 00:02:28.100
Finally for any data science project,

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:33.185
you'll be able to identify strategies for meeting three key factors of success.

00:02:33.185 --> 00:02:35.165
Executive sponsorship,

00:02:35.165 --> 00:02:40.530
strategic alignment with core business interests and scope conditions.
