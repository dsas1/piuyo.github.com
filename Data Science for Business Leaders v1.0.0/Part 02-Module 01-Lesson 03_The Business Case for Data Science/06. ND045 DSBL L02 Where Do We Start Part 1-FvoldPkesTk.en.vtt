00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:07.845
A business is a complex system made up of many different units and processes.

00:00:07.845 --> 00:00:12.240
In order to identify opportunities for data science across a business,

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.235
it's helpful to use a framework that helps organize the complexity of that business.

00:00:17.235 --> 00:00:21.085
One such framework is Michael Porter's value chain.

00:00:21.085 --> 00:00:26.164
In his classic text from 1985 titled Competitive Advantage,

00:00:26.164 --> 00:00:29.690
Porter introduced the value chain as a series of

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:34.715
activities that a business performs in order to create value for its customers.

00:00:34.715 --> 00:00:36.500
The value chain divides

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.225
a company's primary operations into categories such as; inbound logistics,

00:00:41.225 --> 00:00:45.860
operations, outbound logistics, marketing and sales,

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.445
and service after the sale.

00:00:48.445 --> 00:00:54.320
Four additional activities identified as supports for the main value chain include,

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.845
firm infrastructure, human resource management,

00:00:57.845 --> 00:01:01.615
technology development, and procurement.

00:01:01.615 --> 00:01:06.020
By focusing on each individual components of the value chain,

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.110
we might identify opportunities for data science.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.855
We will walk through an example of this process towards the end of this lesson.

00:01:13.855 --> 00:01:18.290
A second framework for identifying opportunities for data science within

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.090
the business mirrors one of

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.950
the company's core financial statements, the income statement.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.500
This is also referred to as a profit and loss statement,

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.995
or more colloquially, a P&amp;L.

00:01:30.995 --> 00:01:32.915
On an income statement,

00:01:32.915 --> 00:01:37.925
operations are represented as either contributing to revenue or expenses.

00:01:37.925 --> 00:01:42.965
The P&amp;L identifies the main categories of revenue producing activities,

00:01:42.965 --> 00:01:44.630
such as, sales revenue,

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.930
service revenue, and other revenue,

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.140
as well as different categories of expenses,

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.375
such as, advertising expenses,

00:01:53.375 --> 00:01:55.070
cost of goods sold,

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.965
employee benefits, payroll, and research and development.

00:01:59.965 --> 00:02:03.980
By identifying subcategories of expenses and revenues,

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:08.150
the P&amp;L can provide a guide for identifying opportunities that mirror

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:13.800
the largest sources of revenue and contributors to expenses for the company.
