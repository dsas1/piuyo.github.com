00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:05.370
This exercise had you complete a rack and stack worksheet

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.570
for six projects in marketing and procurement and supply chain.

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.870
The exercise directed you to determine the relative strategic alignment, cost,

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.190
complexity of implementation, certainty of value capture,

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:24.090
and magnitude of benefit for each of the six projects.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.855
I'll share my ratings from my assessment.

00:00:27.855 --> 00:00:29.310
Your ratings may vary,

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.245
which is absolutely fine.

00:00:31.245 --> 00:00:33.750
As you can see, project 1,

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.855
customer loyalty program, is directly aligned with strategic goals.

00:00:37.855 --> 00:00:40.450
Because of the extensive data required,

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:45.685
as well as the need to build a system of loyalty all for delivery as part of the project,

00:00:45.685 --> 00:00:50.600
this project is only medium in both cost and complexity of implementation.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.555
I project large benefit for this project.

00:00:53.555 --> 00:00:57.755
But because this is the business' first foray into loyalty programs,

00:00:57.755 --> 00:01:01.535
and many different parts of the business must align in order to execute,

00:01:01.535 --> 00:01:05.980
the likelihood of initially capturing value is not high.

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.150
Project 2, customer loyalty assessment,

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.050
is also aligned closely to strategic goals.

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.245
The departmental edges of the project are much more narrow,

00:01:18.245 --> 00:01:22.700
so cost and complexity of implementation are much lower.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.020
Action on the information gained is not clearly defined however,

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.975
so only medium benefit is projected.

00:01:29.975 --> 00:01:32.075
For this reason as well,

00:01:32.075 --> 00:01:36.420
the project does not have high likelihood of value delivery.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:41.230
Project 3, assessing customer attitudes,

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.390
is aligned with strategic goals and has

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.930
the lowest cost and implementation complexity of the set,

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.285
as it requires no new data,

00:01:50.285 --> 00:01:54.605
relying only on extent data from social media sites.

00:01:54.605 --> 00:01:59.090
Moreover, methods of scraping such data are well established,

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.590
which contributes to the high likelihood of capturing value.

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.805
The benefit of this project is projected to be among the lowest of the group however,

00:02:07.805 --> 00:02:10.460
as there is no clear value-driven use

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.125
identified for the information generated from the project.

00:02:14.125 --> 00:02:16.980
Procurement is key to this business,

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.365
so project 4, procurement optimization,

00:02:20.365 --> 00:02:23.255
is closely aligned with strategic goals.

00:02:23.255 --> 00:02:27.140
This project will require purchase of external market data,

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.655
so cost is moderate.

00:02:28.655 --> 00:02:31.760
But there will be little need for new data internally,

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.725
so complexity of implementation should be relatively low.

00:02:35.725 --> 00:02:40.720
Raw material procurement is a critical component of the business' operations,

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.010
so optimizing procurement should bring medium to high benefit.

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:50.470
Material pricing is driven by market factors out of the business' control however,

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.045
so there's substantial uncertainty around value capture.

00:02:55.045 --> 00:02:59.110
Supply chain operations are also mission critical to the company,

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.230
so project 5, supply chain optimization,

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.990
is directly aligned with strategic goals.

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:08.230
It will require a fair amount of data engineering to bring

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.530
data from silos associated with the many factories,

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.390
so cost will be moderate,

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:18.395
but complexity should not be huge once these ETL pipelines are built.

00:03:18.395 --> 00:03:22.095
Purchasing an inventory are cost-heavy operations,

00:03:22.095 --> 00:03:28.030
so centralizing and optimizing these functions should bring large benefit to the company.

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.015
The project's success is incumbent on

00:03:31.015 --> 00:03:34.539
operational changes in not only procurement and inventory,

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:37.120
but also delivery, so the project has

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.760
only medium certainty of delivering on the value expected of it.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.780
Finally, project 6, demand forecasting,

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.605
is also closely aligned to strategic goals.

00:03:48.605 --> 00:03:53.335
This project will rely primarily on established data streams,

00:03:53.335 --> 00:03:57.265
so both cost and complexity should be relatively low.

00:03:57.265 --> 00:04:01.410
Being able to anticipate demand swings, and schedule production,

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:06.174
and manage inventory accordingly are important levers to the business,

00:04:06.174 --> 00:04:10.595
so the project should bring medium to high benefit to the business.

00:04:10.595 --> 00:04:14.750
Moreover, demand forecasting methods are well established,

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:20.550
so this project should be among the most likely to deliver on its expected value.
