00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:04.710
This exercise asks you to take the components used

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.665
to rate the various projects' feasibility,

00:00:07.665 --> 00:00:10.905
potential impact, and likelihood of value capture,

00:00:10.905 --> 00:00:15.015
and represent them using the data science opportunity matrix.

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:18.630
I take these three components for each project and

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.275
represent them using the data science opportunity matrix.

00:00:22.275 --> 00:00:25.380
These follow from my assessments for each project

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.740
that were completed as part of the previous exercise.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.610
It's quite possible yours may differ, which is just fine.

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.875
As you can see, Project 1,

00:00:34.875 --> 00:00:38.305
Customer Loyalty Program projects high impact.

00:00:38.305 --> 00:00:40.610
But because of the extensive data required,

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.245
as well as the need to build a system of loyalty offered delivery as part of the project,

00:00:45.245 --> 00:00:49.710
it's only medium in feasibility because this is the business' first foray in

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.800
the loyalty programs and

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.220
many different parts of the business must align in order to execute.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.310
The likelihood of initially capturing value is not high.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.340
Project 2, Customer Loyalty Assessment is much higher in

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:08.995
feasibility as the departmental edges of the project are much more narrow.

00:01:08.995 --> 00:01:11.825
It only projects medium impact, however,

00:01:11.825 --> 00:01:15.350
as action on the information gained is not clearly defined.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:16.940
For this reason as well,

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.110
the project does not have high likelihood of value delivery.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.825
Project 3, Assessing Customer Attitudes has highest feasibility of the set,

00:01:26.825 --> 00:01:28.715
as it requires no new data,

00:01:28.715 --> 00:01:32.315
relying on extant data from social media sites only.

00:01:32.315 --> 00:01:36.545
Moreover, methods for scraping such data are well established,

00:01:36.545 --> 00:01:39.815
which contributes to the high likelihood of capturing value.

00:01:39.815 --> 00:01:44.330
The impact of this project is projected to be among the lowest of the group however,

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.000
as there's no clear value-driven use

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.635
identified for the information generated from the project.

00:01:50.635 --> 00:01:56.060
Project 4, Procurement Optimization requires little new data,

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.940
so therefore is medium to high in feasibility.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.740
Raw material procurement is a critical component of the business' operations.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.600
So optimizing procurement should bring medium to high impact.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.660
Material pricing is driven by market factors out of the business' control,

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.815
however, so there is substantial uncertainty around value capture.

00:02:18.815 --> 00:02:25.055
Project 5, Supply Chain Optimization also requires little new data,

00:02:25.055 --> 00:02:27.590
so therefore has medium feasibility.

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.340
Purchasing an inventory are cost heavy operations.

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.380
Centralizing and optimizing these functions should bring high impact.

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.645
The project's success is incumbent on

00:02:38.645 --> 00:02:42.995
operational changes in not only procurement and inventory, but also delivery.

00:02:42.995 --> 00:02:48.115
So the project has only medium certainty of delivering on the value expected of it.

00:02:48.115 --> 00:02:51.355
Project 6, Demand Forecasting,

00:02:51.355 --> 00:02:54.590
relies primarily on established data streams,

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.305
so it has medium to high feasibility.

00:02:57.305 --> 00:03:02.690
Being able to anticipate demand swings as scheduled production and manage inventory

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.150
accordingly are important levers to

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.950
the business that should bring medium to high business impact.

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.135
Demand forecasting methods are well established,

00:03:12.135 --> 00:03:17.300
so this project should be among the most likely to deliver on its expected value.

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.420
The course exercises and capstone projects will

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.215
direct you to craft an opportunity matrix of your own.

00:03:23.215 --> 00:03:25.910
You may want to take a bit of time now to study

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.000
the opportunity matrix and how the feasibility,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.510
potential impact, and likelihood of value capture of

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.830
each project drives how that project is represented on the matrix.
