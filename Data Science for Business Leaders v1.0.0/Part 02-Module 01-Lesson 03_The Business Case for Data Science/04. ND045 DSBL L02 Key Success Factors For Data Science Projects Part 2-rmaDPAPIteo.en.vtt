00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:06.405
One way to assess a business' readiness for data science initiatives,

00:00:06.405 --> 00:00:12.000
is to see the degree to which they meet four scope conditions for data science success.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.640
The first of these concerns data.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.080
As I've said before,

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.940
data is a critical component,

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.520
perhaps the most critical component,

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.055
of a data science initiative.

00:00:23.055 --> 00:00:25.440
Data can be structured,

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.040
which means it's represented neatly in categorical or numerical form and held in

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:35.115
tables or common data stores that can be easily managed in a few dimensions.

00:00:35.115 --> 00:00:36.615
On the other hand,

00:00:36.615 --> 00:00:39.885
often the case is that your data is unstructured.

00:00:39.885 --> 00:00:42.480
It's embedded in free text, images,

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.965
or audio that's difficult to neatly organize due to high variability in dimensionality.

00:00:48.965 --> 00:00:52.970
Regardless of whether your data is structured or unstructured,

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.245
you will need to source that data wherever it resides in the business

00:00:57.245 --> 00:01:03.060
and build ETL pipelines to bring the data to the point of analytics.

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.285
The second scope condition has to do with data infrastructure.

00:01:08.285 --> 00:01:13.430
We need to make sure that technical architecture supporting data collection and

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.790
storage is able to deliver high quality data to the point of analytics.

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.215
Moreover, we must ensure that proper data security is in place.

00:01:23.215 --> 00:01:28.200
We'll talk more about data infrastructure in a lesson later in this course.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.095
A third critical area is business processes.

00:01:33.095 --> 00:01:36.289
We need to make sure that the right process

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:39.470
is set up for maintaining data science initiatives.

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.085
In particular, inside the data science organization,

00:01:43.085 --> 00:01:49.670
I'm strongly in favor of using the Machine Learning Development Lifecycle, or MLDLC.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.770
I've included some references to

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.910
the Machine Learning Development Lifecycle in the notes for this section.

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.775
Outside the data science organization,

00:01:58.775 --> 00:02:01.250
we need to make sure that we have the business processes

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.875
in place to work with supporting organizations,

00:02:03.875 --> 00:02:06.475
such as engineering, technology,

00:02:06.475 --> 00:02:12.120
and the various functional areas that serve as the focus for data science projects.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.010
Finally, the fourth scope condition that must be in

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.925
place concerns data science tools and frameworks.

00:02:19.925 --> 00:02:22.550
When we approach data science development,

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.520
we need to make sure that we understand our choices in

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.165
the right direction with regard to programming languages,

00:02:29.165 --> 00:02:33.305
machine learning libraries, and version control systems.

00:02:33.305 --> 00:02:36.410
Once again, I've included several references for

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.350
these tools and frameworks in the notes for this section.
