00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:04.830
As we began to discuss in a previous video,

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.620
managing expectations of stakeholders regarding

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.540
data science projects is key to ensuring the success of those projects.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.610
There are several aspects of setting

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.775
expectations that you'll want to consider as a data science later.

00:00:18.775 --> 00:00:24.485
First, you need to be realistic about the project's potential value to the business.

00:00:24.485 --> 00:00:27.755
When you're first selling the idea of a data science project,

00:00:27.755 --> 00:00:32.495
it could be tempting to exaggerate the benefits that the project is likely to realize.

00:00:32.495 --> 00:00:36.290
While this may lead to initial excitement for the data science project,

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.520
it will ultimately threaten the project's long-term viability as it becomes

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.190
increasingly unlikely to deliver on unrealistic expectations.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.010
A second aspect of setting expectations has to do with

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.865
the likelihood of the project delivering on the value that's expected of it.

00:00:52.865 --> 00:00:57.145
Are there risks and uncertainties in whether the project will deliver?

00:00:57.145 --> 00:01:00.770
These need to be acknowledged upfront so that if something should

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.295
arise that calls the success of the project into question,

00:01:04.295 --> 00:01:07.235
stakeholders will not be caught unaware

00:01:07.235 --> 00:01:11.615
because you will have already addressed that issue with them beforehand.

00:01:11.615 --> 00:01:17.300
A third aspect of setting expectations has to do with the timing of value capture.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.460
How long will it take for the project to deliver on its promise.

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.670
I once had a CEO who was convinced that machine learning projects could not

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.185
possibly deliver value until their third year of being in implementation.

00:01:30.185 --> 00:01:32.735
This is clearly a misconception.

00:01:32.735 --> 00:01:35.210
On the flip side, communicating

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.890
overly aggressive timelines can hurt your project's prospects as well,

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:45.335
as stakeholders tend not to accept repeated delays with much grace and understanding.

00:01:45.335 --> 00:01:49.010
Finally, setting expectations involves communicating

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.435
any risks and potential blockers for the project.

00:01:52.435 --> 00:01:56.105
Is there a risk that the project might bring negative press?

00:01:56.105 --> 00:02:00.125
Might it possibly contribute to discord in the organization?

00:02:00.125 --> 00:02:05.140
Might organizational factors potentially block the success of the project?

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.210
Identifying risks and potential blockers

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.400
upfront can help build credibility for you as the project leader,

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.510
and can help stakeholders weather

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.750
the challenges that will inevitably pop up along the way.
