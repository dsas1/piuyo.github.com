00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:03.810
Throughout my career I've seen

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.365
many successful and many unsuccessful data science initiatives.

00:00:08.365 --> 00:00:13.380
Many factors I've seen that lead to successful data science practices are reflected in

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.130
a published article from McKinsey about

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:19.760
drivers for successfully scaling data science in the business.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.250
These factors broadly break down into

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.170
three categories which they represent as strategic alignment,

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.130
putting in place the foundational requirements of data, people,

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.460
and infrastructure, and embedding data science and

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.020
analytics throughout the company to promote a data-driven culture.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.765
With regard to strategic alignment,

00:00:41.765 --> 00:00:43.655
the article recommends first,

00:00:43.655 --> 00:00:47.630
obtaining a strong unified commitment from all levels of management,

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:54.270
and second, increasing analytics investments with a focus on the last mile.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.990
Toward building foundational capabilities,

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:03.725
the article recommends developing a clear data strategy with strong data governance,

00:01:03.725 --> 00:01:07.755
using sophisticated analytics methodologies,

00:01:07.755 --> 00:01:13.700
possessing deep analytics expertise enabled by a tailored talent strategy,

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.845
and creating cross-functional, collaborative agile teams.

00:01:18.845 --> 00:01:24.965
Finally, in promoting a data-driven culture by embedding analytics through the company,

00:01:24.965 --> 00:01:29.705
the authors recommend prioritizing top decision-making processes,

00:01:29.705 --> 00:01:33.815
establishing clear decision-making rights and accountability,

00:01:33.815 --> 00:01:38.820
and empowering the front lines to make analytics driven decisions.
