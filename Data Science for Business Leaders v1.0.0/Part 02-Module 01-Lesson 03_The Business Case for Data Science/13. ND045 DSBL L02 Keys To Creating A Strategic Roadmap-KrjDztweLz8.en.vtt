00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:05.265
Having launched many data science practices in my career,

00:00:05.265 --> 00:00:10.125
I've also developed a list of seven keys to creating strategic roadmaps.

00:00:10.125 --> 00:00:11.790
These are as follows.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.905
First, embrace the philosophy of many experiments to gain momentum.

00:00:16.905 --> 00:00:21.170
Executing multiple limited scope experiments helps to

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:26.370
identify what works and what doesn't and deliver value more quickly.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.225
Second, start with narrow examples.

00:00:30.225 --> 00:00:33.230
These generate stories, allow the art of the

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.570
possible that you can leverage to gain

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.545
momentum and scale accordingly across the business.

00:00:38.545 --> 00:00:42.725
I might favor a relatively narrowly scoped initial project

00:00:42.725 --> 00:00:46.975
to prove out data science and get stakeholders behind the project.

00:00:46.975 --> 00:00:50.000
Third, select only high impact,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.025
high feasibility use cases,

00:00:52.025 --> 00:00:55.175
especially at the beginning of a data science initiative.

00:00:55.175 --> 00:00:58.550
Delivering a project successfully is more important than

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.739
having huge impact for your initial data science initiatives.

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:07.445
Fourth, consider the milestones relevant to each project.

00:01:07.445 --> 00:01:13.370
Publicizing milestones helps maintain momentum and interest among stakeholders.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:18.755
Fifth, look for overlap between milestones in various projects.

00:01:18.755 --> 00:01:21.905
As you build a portfolio of data science projects,

00:01:21.905 --> 00:01:23.075
it can be helpful,

00:01:23.075 --> 00:01:28.930
especially initially, to choose groups of projects that share similar milestones.

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:35.455
Sixth, start to map these milestones against time based on resources available.

00:01:35.455 --> 00:01:39.290
We will talk in the next section about setting expectations.

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.030
Matching resources to the timing of milestones is a key step to this.

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.660
Finally, seven, another aspect of setting

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:53.395
expectations is to underpromise and overdeliver to drive success for your business.

00:01:53.395 --> 00:01:56.060
With your enthusiasm for data science,

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.280
it can be tempting to oversell your projects and anticipated benefits.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.690
It's much better to temper that enthusiasm,

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.410
publicize relatively modest goals,

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:11.940
and save the excitement for when you far surpass everybody's expectations.
