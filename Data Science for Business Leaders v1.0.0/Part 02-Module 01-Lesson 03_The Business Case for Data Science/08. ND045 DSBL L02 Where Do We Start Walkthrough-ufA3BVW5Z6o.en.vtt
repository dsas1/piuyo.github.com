00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:05.970
Let's walk through an example of using one of these frameworks to

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.230
identify opportunities for data science within the business.

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.420
Consider the following scenario.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.480
Specialty coffee retailer, Fantastic Coffee believes that data science might benefit

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.910
the business and would like to identify

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.395
data science project opportunities across the business operations.

00:00:25.395 --> 00:00:29.010
Let's use Michael Porter's value chain as our framework for identifying

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.165
data science projects that might benefit Fantastic Coffee.

00:00:33.165 --> 00:00:36.915
Let's first consider primary operations.

00:00:36.915 --> 00:00:40.940
Regarding inbound logistics, Fantastic has contracts with

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.815
many long-term suppliers for the raw materials for their coffee and food items.

00:00:45.815 --> 00:00:51.545
These items must be routed to each of Fantastic's many locations.

00:00:51.545 --> 00:00:56.330
Data science projects might focus on either supply chain optimization or

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:01.960
logistics optimization to cut down costs associated with those two areas.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.290
Operations in local Fantastic Coffee sites are run according to company policy.

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.030
Tracking time spent with various activities as well as

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:17.200
local labor costs could see data science projects to identify operational improvements.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.690
Regarding outbound logistics, Fantastic Coffee

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.650
relies on retail sites that provide counter order service.

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.595
Some sites offer drive-through service as well.

00:01:27.595 --> 00:01:32.150
Data science projects could focus on customer service optimization and

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.370
could also be used to identify sites that would

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:37.025
benefit from adding drive-through service.

00:01:37.025 --> 00:01:42.035
Fantastic focuses its marketing on regional media and print advertising,

00:01:42.035 --> 00:01:47.000
as well as advertising and offers through search engines and social media sites.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.720
Data science projects could target the optimization of

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:57.035
these media strategies and could automate A/B testing of alternative marketing messages.

00:01:57.035 --> 00:02:01.670
Fantastic emphasizes top quality customer service and has

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.380
traditionally selected and trained employees with service provision as a goal.

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.020
Data science could be used to identify

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.380
characteristics of potential employees that are most strongly

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.170
associated with high-quality service so that

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.405
identification and hiring of these candidates could be expedited.

00:02:19.405 --> 00:02:23.430
Just as we did for Fantastic's primary operations,

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.050
we could use the value chain framework to identify data science opportunities

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.920
specific to support activities such as firm infrastructure,

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.840
human resource management, technology development, and procurement.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.945
By using Michael Porter's value chain framework,

00:02:38.945 --> 00:02:42.710
we've now identified several potential data science projects that

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:47.520
might benefit Fantastic Coffee across its business operations.
