00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:04.860
I take these three components and represent

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.935
them using the data science opportunity matrix.

00:00:07.935 --> 00:00:11.130
The course exercises and capstone project,

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.550
will direct you to craft opportunity matrices of your own.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:17.400
So you may want to take a bit of time now to study

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.090
the opportunity matrix and how the feasibility,

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.720
potential impact, and likelihood of value

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.359
capture of each project drives how that project is represented on the matrix.

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.735
For this new set of candidate projects,

00:00:33.735 --> 00:00:36.920
project 1 is medium feasibility,

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.914
medium to high impact,

00:00:38.914 --> 00:00:42.850
and has medium to high likelihood of capturing value.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.145
Project 2 is high feasibility,

00:00:46.145 --> 00:00:50.530
medium impact, and highly likely to capture value.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.505
Project 3 is low feasibility,

00:00:53.505 --> 00:00:58.870
high impact with medium likelihood of capturing value.

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.790
Project 4 is medium to high feasibility,

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.570
high impact with medium likelihood of value capture.

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:13.100
Project 5 is low feasibility and medium to high impact,

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.885
but it has a low likelihood of capturing value,

00:01:16.885 --> 00:01:20.685
and so forth for project 6,

00:01:20.685 --> 00:01:23.845
project 7, and project 8.

00:01:23.845 --> 00:01:28.070
This completed opportunity matrix provides a visual tool for

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.170
representing all projects with respect to the three characteristics of feasibility,

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.415
impact, and likelihood of value capture.

00:01:36.415 --> 00:01:40.610
From here then, we can start to prioritize projects.

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.245
For our first project,

00:01:42.245 --> 00:01:44.365
I would choose project 2.

00:01:44.365 --> 00:01:47.210
Though we'll not have the impact of say,

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.775
projects 4, 1 or 3,

00:01:49.775 --> 00:01:52.565
it is among the most likely to capture value

00:01:52.565 --> 00:01:56.265
and deliver on the promise of data science to the business.

00:01:56.265 --> 00:01:59.680
I might begin to build our data science roadmap

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.830
then with project 2 as our launch project.

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.470
Assuming my project identification and

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.415
opportunity assessment might take several weeks before launching any project,

00:02:09.415 --> 00:02:14.420
I've decided that this will launch one month into our data science initiative.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.710
Now that I've identified a first project,

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.680
which project should follow?

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.750
Project 1 and project 4 are both compelling options here.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.415
Each would bring high impact and they both are pretty feasible.

00:02:29.415 --> 00:02:32.710
Since we're at the beginning of our data science journey,

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:38.450
I'll still favor likelihood of value capture over small differences in impact.

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.770
As such, I'll choose project 1 as our second project on the roadmap.

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.940
I may time that to launch at,

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.420
say the beginning of the fourth month of the initiative.

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.250
Hopefully the first project will have delivered by this time,

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.000
so the second project will capitalize on momentum from the first.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.410
Project 4 would serve as our third project.

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.580
It is higher in feasibility and potential impact,

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.710
and we hopefully will have started to build

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:10.225
a foundation of success from our first two projects,

00:03:10.225 --> 00:03:13.880
so I'd be willing to take a swing at a high impact project,

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.165
even though there is a little more uncertainty regarding

00:03:17.165 --> 00:03:21.325
whether the project will deliver on its promised impact.

00:03:21.325 --> 00:03:26.474
With projects 2, 1 and 3 as our first three projects,

00:03:26.474 --> 00:03:29.025
which shall we choose as our fourth?

00:03:29.025 --> 00:03:33.515
In practice, we may consider factors outside of what is represented here,

00:03:33.515 --> 00:03:35.750
such as whether any remaining projects might

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.840
capitalize on advances made in the first three,

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.540
or whether they might use data systems set

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.825
up during establishment of the first three projects,

00:03:44.825 --> 00:03:49.010
or involve personnel who have developed specialized insight through one of

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.800
the first projects that would be valuable to our particular next project.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.070
Here, in the absence of such contextual information,

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.280
I'll choose project 3.

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:05.165
Project 3 may be more challenging to implement due to its lower feasibility,

00:04:05.165 --> 00:04:07.220
but it projects high impact,

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.620
so the business may be willing to be a little more

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.950
patient in expecting this project to deliver.

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.910
We might time it to launch a quarter after the third project,

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:18.980
at which point the business should have

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:24.420
a healthy portfolio of successful projects to leverage going forward.
