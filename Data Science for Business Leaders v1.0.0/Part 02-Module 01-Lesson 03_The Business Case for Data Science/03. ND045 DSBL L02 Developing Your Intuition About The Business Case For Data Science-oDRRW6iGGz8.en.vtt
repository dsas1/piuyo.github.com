00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:05.725
To develop your intuition about the business case for data science,

00:00:05.725 --> 00:00:10.190
we're going to sharpen our focus to that first word; business.

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:15.085
Data Science initiatives typically target one of two general business goals,

00:00:15.085 --> 00:00:19.100
to increase revenues or to decrease costs.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.840
Our objective as a data science leader is to assess

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:28.250
various areas of the business to get our best idea about where data science might fit in.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.565
This is going to require deep contextual knowledge of the business's operations.

00:00:33.565 --> 00:00:35.710
Exactly the sort of knowledge that

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.550
a functional business leader will have acquired during her time in an organization.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.265
I will ask you to consider different parts of the organization,

00:00:44.265 --> 00:00:48.455
breaking down areas of examination using a framework that might align to

00:00:48.455 --> 00:00:53.105
either the value chain of the business or the business's income statement,

00:00:53.105 --> 00:00:57.835
known colloquially as the P&amp;L or profit and loss statement.

00:00:57.835 --> 00:01:01.850
We will take different sub-components of either the value chain or

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.195
P&amp;L and assess whether there is an opportunity for data science within each component.

00:01:07.195 --> 00:01:12.110
We will then prioritize these opportunities based on the complexity of each project,

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.915
the likely benefit that each project might bring,

00:01:14.915 --> 00:01:18.985
and any risks or uncertainty in delivering on each project.

00:01:18.985 --> 00:01:21.890
All of these things require intuition about

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.489
the business that is embedded in business contextual knowledge.
