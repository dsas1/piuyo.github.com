00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:05.985
The exercise asked you to identify your top project,

00:00:05.985 --> 00:00:10.125
among the six represented on the opportunity matrix.

00:00:10.125 --> 00:00:14.040
For that project, you were to provide examples on how to

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.450
set expectations across each of the following four categories.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.840
The potential project value to the business,

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.659
the likelihood of value capture,

00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:27.405
the timing of value capture,

00:00:27.405 --> 00:00:30.870
and any risks or potential blockers.

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.960
Based on our opportunity matrix from before,

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.070
my first project would be project 6, demand forecasting.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.120
It may not bring as great of impact as projects 1 and 5,

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.950
and it may be slightly less feasible than projects 2 and 3.

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.620
But it's high likelihood of value capture,

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.950
along with relatively high feasibility and impact,

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.390
make it a good first project to establish enthusiasm from stakeholders,

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.945
and build momentum for other projects in the pipeline.

00:00:59.945 --> 00:01:03.200
I will describe several areas for which I want to

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.575
set expectations for the demand forecasting project.

00:01:06.575 --> 00:01:10.940
Please keep in mind that your own responses may differ from mine.

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.255
First, let's consider expectations to set

00:01:14.255 --> 00:01:17.485
regarding the potential project value to the business.

00:01:17.485 --> 00:01:20.375
This project may enhance the business's ability

00:01:20.375 --> 00:01:23.120
to schedule production and manage inventory,

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:28.860
providing greater efficiency and lowering cost of production and inventory.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.485
Next, let's consider likelihood of value capture.

00:01:33.485 --> 00:01:37.535
This project is highly likely to deliver on its potential.

00:01:37.535 --> 00:01:39.680
All necessary data is available,

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.155
nothing new needs to be collected.

00:01:42.155 --> 00:01:46.680
Demand forecasting methods are many and well-known.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.005
Now let's consider timing of value capture.

00:01:51.005 --> 00:01:55.205
This project should start delivering value in the very near term.

00:01:55.205 --> 00:01:57.680
Models can leverage historical data,

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.060
so no time needs to be spent waiting for new data to be collected.

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.570
Many forecasting models are available off the shelf,

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.805
so programming and model development should be relatively quick.

00:02:09.805 --> 00:02:12.830
Finally, let's consider what risks and

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.210
potential blockers we should communicate to stakeholders.

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.510
This is an additive project,

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.910
current performance and functionality will not depend on a new model,

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.920
so there is not much risk of disruption to the business.

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.935
Data availability could end up being a blocker.

00:02:30.935 --> 00:02:37.710
Additionally, changes in customer behavior over time could render forecasts invalid.
