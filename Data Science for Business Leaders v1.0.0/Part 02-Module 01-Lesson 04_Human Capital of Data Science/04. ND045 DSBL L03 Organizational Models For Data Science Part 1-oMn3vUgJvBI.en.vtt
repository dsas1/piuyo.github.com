00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:05.460
Before launching a data science practice or initiative,

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.880
it is wise to be strategic about how to organize

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.045
that data science practice within the larger business organization.

00:00:13.045 --> 00:00:16.100
I favor specifying organizational models for

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.090
data science in a way that reflects the current business organization,

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.810
as well as the role of data science within that organization.

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.200
In general, I see four key components

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.115
that characterize how best to organize the data science function.

00:00:31.115 --> 00:00:33.095
The first of these is,

00:00:33.095 --> 00:00:36.395
who is the ultimate owner of the resources?

00:00:36.395 --> 00:00:39.305
Are resources owned and managed via

00:00:39.305 --> 00:00:43.510
a central organization or via decentralized business units?

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.075
The second is more specific to resource allocation.

00:00:47.075 --> 00:00:51.730
How are resources allocated and deployed throughout the organization?

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.685
Third, who is in charge of those allocations?

00:00:55.685 --> 00:00:58.130
In turn, who is in charge of

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.645
determining which initiatives receive the green light for funding?

00:01:01.645 --> 00:01:07.910
C-suite executives, functional business leaders, business unit heads?

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:13.205
Finally, who is in control of the strategic agenda of the company?

00:01:13.205 --> 00:01:16.340
Is this centralized or decentralized?

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.970
Is strategy developed in the executive leadership group,

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.465
or is it found in functional units throughout the company?

00:01:23.465 --> 00:01:30.629
These four issues together guide decisions around organizational models for data science.
