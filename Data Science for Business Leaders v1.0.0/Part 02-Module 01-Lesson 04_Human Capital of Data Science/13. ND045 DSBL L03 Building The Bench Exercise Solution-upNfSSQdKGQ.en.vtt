00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:07.050
Part one of this exercise asked you to identify the first 10 professional roles,

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.905
for which you would recruit for a new data science organization.

00:00:10.905 --> 00:00:15.690
How would you organize these roles into teams within the organization?

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.440
If I had 10 positions from my data science team,

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.770
I would organize my professionals into three groups,

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.635
much like in the walkthrough we just finished.

00:00:25.635 --> 00:00:29.725
First, I would fill two project-specific teams,

00:00:29.725 --> 00:00:34.055
that would be deployed on individual projects on the data science roadmap.

00:00:34.055 --> 00:00:37.760
Again, I would also keep a third group of specialists,

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.390
who would float between the two teams.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.640
My first team would be heavy on data scientists,

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.850
as the skill set associated with that role tends to be able to complete

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.269
many of the task critical on the road to developing prototypes,

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:51.820
and proofs of concept.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.460
I would also hire a data analyst,

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.245
who could free up some of the data scientists to complete more technical tasks.

00:00:59.245 --> 00:01:01.895
I would not hire only generalists, however,

00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:05.510
a machine-learning engineer would be a valuable specialist for teams

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.830
developing data science projects for which machine learning is key.

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:15.860
Once again, I would probably keep this same structure for my second team as well.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.740
I would fill my last two positions with

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.655
a data engineer and a data visualization engineer.

00:01:21.655 --> 00:01:25.760
Again, at this point the goal is to develop working prototypes,

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.240
I believe the data engineering and data visualization skills,

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.795
will not be in demand enough to allocate full time specialists to individual teams.

00:01:34.795 --> 00:01:37.820
The second part of this exercise asked

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.985
how you would prioritize your organization or build-out,

00:01:40.985 --> 00:01:46.730
if leadership were to allocate only four new FTEs for your data science organization,

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:48.955
during the current fiscal year.

00:01:48.955 --> 00:01:52.175
My first hire would be a data scientist,

00:01:52.175 --> 00:01:55.390
in particular, a data science hacker.

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.130
Having a generalist data scientist,

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.350
will allow the project to get started as

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.100
this position will be able to set up all aspects ETL,

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.935
modeling, visualization of the initial proof of concept.

00:02:08.935 --> 00:02:12.215
Second, I'd hire a machine-learning engineer.

00:02:12.215 --> 00:02:15.030
The first project relies heavily on machine learning,

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.780
so this professional will be key to building the proof

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.025
of concept and then optimizing for production.

00:02:21.025 --> 00:02:23.955
My third hire would be a data engineer.

00:02:23.955 --> 00:02:28.160
Proof of concept, ETL might be handled by the data science hacker,

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.955
but for production, we will need production quality ETL,

00:02:31.955 --> 00:02:34.465
designed by a data engineer.

00:02:34.465 --> 00:02:39.895
I would round out my first team with a second data scientist hire.

00:02:39.895 --> 00:02:42.895
Adding another data scientists to the team,

00:02:42.895 --> 00:02:47.645
will ease the burden on the first hire and also free up the machine-learning engineer

00:02:47.645 --> 00:02:53.430
and data engineer from any general data science tasks they may have been covering on.
