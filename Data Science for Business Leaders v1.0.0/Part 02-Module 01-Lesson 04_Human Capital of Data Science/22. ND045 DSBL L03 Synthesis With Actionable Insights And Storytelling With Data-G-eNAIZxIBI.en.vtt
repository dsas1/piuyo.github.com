00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:04.304
When we are leading data science initiatives,

00:00:04.304 --> 00:00:08.040
it is critical for us to approach communication with stakeholders in

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.705
a way most effective towards achieving our communication objectives.

00:00:12.705 --> 00:00:17.010
To this end, I will introduce two communication frameworks that I have

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.090
found helpful in communicating about data science projects to executives,

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.470
other business leaders, and stakeholders throughout the company.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.570
The first of these is Barbara Minto's pyramid principle.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.799
The pyramid principle name comes from the idea that structuring

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:40.660
your ideas with supporting information follows logic that resembles a pyramid.

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.679
In its simplest form,

00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:44.450
the pyramid principle has you state

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.685
your ultimate conclusion as supported by several ideas or recommendations,

00:00:49.685 --> 00:00:53.345
each of which itself is supported by several facts,

00:00:53.345 --> 00:00:55.565
are supporting points of logic.

00:00:55.565 --> 00:00:58.850
The pyramid principle is particularly appealing for

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.940
communicating with executive leaders who

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.820
tend to have shorter attention spans and therefore

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.735
must be given the most important information first.

00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:11.480
The second framework I have found helpful in

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.750
communicating about data science initiatives is J.D.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.870
Schramm's seven part formula for storytelling

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:22.000
success in presentations and business meetings.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.580
Part 1 is parachute in, don't preamble.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.945
Get to the point.

00:01:27.945 --> 00:01:30.615
Deliver the action first.

00:01:30.615 --> 00:01:35.480
Part 2, is choose first and final words carefully.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.230
The beginning and ending of a story are the most memorable.

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:43.555
So be intentional about how you craft these parts of the story.

00:01:43.555 --> 00:01:48.905
Part 3 is, follow the Goldilocks theory of details.

00:01:48.905 --> 00:01:52.430
Focus on providing just the right amount of detail,

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.830
lest you leave your audience either bored or under-informed.

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:02.600
Part four; focus your delivery on one person with one thought.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.195
In the nervous moments of a presentation,

00:02:05.195 --> 00:02:07.490
try to maintain connections with individuals in

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.425
the room through eye contact and deliberate speaking.

00:02:11.425 --> 00:02:15.940
Part 5 is, consider the power of poetry.

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.310
Carefully select the words you intend to use and

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.700
arrange them intentionally to carry the greatest amount of meaning.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.490
Part 6, use silence for impact and emphasis.

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.220
Intentional silence can be uncomfortable for a speaker,

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.875
but it serves as a powerful aid toward driving home a point you wish to emphasize.

00:02:36.875 --> 00:02:41.190
Finally, part 7, know your AIM,

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.165
your audience, intent, and message.

00:02:45.165 --> 00:02:48.170
At all times throughout a presentation,

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.050
you must remain mindful of your AIM,

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.740
your audience, your intent, and your message.

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.470
One of the biggest challenges of data science is communicating with

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.485
stakeholders who may not be as comfortable with technical concepts as you are.

00:03:05.485 --> 00:03:10.895
Minto's pyramid principle and Schramm's seven-part framework for storytelling

00:03:10.895 --> 00:03:12.935
provide guidance towards becoming

00:03:12.935 --> 00:03:17.520
unexceptional data science storyteller and communicator.
