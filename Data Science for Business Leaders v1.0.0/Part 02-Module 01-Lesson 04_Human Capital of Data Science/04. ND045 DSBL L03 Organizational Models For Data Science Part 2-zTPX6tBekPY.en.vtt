00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:05.340
Organizational models often evolve organically,

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.710
as people throughout the business independently

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.760
identify and pursue solutions based in data science.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.170
The first step in many organizations' journey towards data-driven practice

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.930
then is the evolution of a completely decentralized data science organization.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.970
In such an organization,

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.880
functional areas and business units independently

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.915
define and manage their data and data science initiatives.

00:00:30.915 --> 00:00:33.560
The organization therefore has

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.260
no overall data strategy and there is

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.985
very little alignment or coordination across different areas of the business.

00:00:40.985 --> 00:00:42.935
At the other extreme,

00:00:42.935 --> 00:00:46.550
a completely centralized model, like a government,

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.000
manages all data and data science related projects

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.715
centrally through a group that typically includes a chief data officer.

00:00:54.715 --> 00:00:59.690
This tends to be highly controlled and highly prescriptive with coordination

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.915
of all activities supported through central human capital and infrastructure management.

00:01:04.915 --> 00:01:07.250
These two organizational models,

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.865
completely decentralized and completely centralized,

00:01:10.865 --> 00:01:13.400
tend to reflect the early stages of

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:19.280
organizational data science models as organizations evolve in their data science journey.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.920
At some point along this journey,

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.420
businesses often find that some combination of central management and

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:32.110
decentralized execution work best to manage data science in their organization.

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:38.915
This combination of decentralized and centralized management is known as federation.

00:01:38.915 --> 00:01:42.470
A federated functional model, for example,

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.830
gives individual functional areas the responsibility for

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.350
maintaining data assets and executing data science initiatives,

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.300
but leverages a chief data officer and

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.060
possibly a central data science function as

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.020
a facilitator and strategic leader of those initiatives.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:07.100
Likewise, a federated BU based model also leverages centralized facilitation,

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.320
but gives individual business units

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.730
the responsibility for data assets and data science execution.

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.670
A more central federated model includes

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.030
greater strategic and operational responsibility

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.780
with the chief data officer's organization,

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.110
with business units or functional areas managing data assets and

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.180
data science initiatives under

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.350
the strong guidance of that centralized data science organization.
