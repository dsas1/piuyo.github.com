00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:06.030
Now that we have learned strategies for building the data science team,

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:10.125
we turn our attention to managing the data science process.

00:00:10.125 --> 00:00:12.120
In this section, I discussed

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.165
several alternative project management paradigms

00:00:15.165 --> 00:00:17.910
that are used to manage the data science process.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.580
Many data science and engineering projects are

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.955
initially managed using a unidirectional approach.

00:00:23.955 --> 00:00:25.770
This is generally known as

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.555
waterfall management due to the unidirectionality of a waterfall.

00:00:30.555 --> 00:00:33.500
Projects pass through various stages from

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.430
conception to implementation, and ultimately maintenance.

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.365
Before the project is launched,

00:00:39.365 --> 00:00:44.045
requirements are specified using a product requirements document.

00:00:44.045 --> 00:00:48.020
Software architecture is designed in a second design stage,

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:53.015
and then the software is built and implemented during an implementation stage.

00:00:53.015 --> 00:00:56.030
Once complete, the correct operation of

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.570
software is verified through a verification stage,

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.175
and the software is ultimately maintained during a maintenance phase.

00:01:04.175 --> 00:01:08.120
While this approach seems very logical, in practice,

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.830
data science team initiatives tend not to be linear and unidirectional.

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.825
Substantial uncertainty exists throughout the modal data science project,

00:01:17.825 --> 00:01:22.460
often requiring multiple iterations and regularly stepping

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.845
back one or two steps in order to move forward towards successful completion.

00:01:27.845 --> 00:01:31.460
A popular alternative to waterfall, in fact,

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:37.060
the most popular framework now used in software development is the agile framework.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:43.325
Since a group of 17 software visionaries penned the Agile Manifesto nearly 20 years ago,

00:01:43.325 --> 00:01:48.100
agile methodologies have taken the software development world by storm.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.869
Agile is seen by many as a preferred way to manage projects in small,

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:57.550
workable increments rather than in large stages.

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.670
Via agile, projects evolve continuously with

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.265
regular evaluation and work divided into consumable increments.

00:02:06.265 --> 00:02:08.150
Two popular components of

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:12.580
agile project management include the kanban and scrum frameworks.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.865
In kanban, tasks are represented on a kanban board,

00:02:16.865 --> 00:02:22.085
which is a visual representation of work tasks and their status towards completion.

00:02:22.085 --> 00:02:27.350
In scrum, work is divided into two-week increments known as sprints,

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:32.615
and assigned via points that reflect levels of effort required for completion.

00:02:32.615 --> 00:02:36.620
One challenge to managing data science work via sprints is that

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.930
data science tasks tend to have

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.190
greater uncertainty than traditional software development task,

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.295
and are thus harder to manage in two-week increments.

00:02:46.295 --> 00:02:51.710
Data science teams often evolve from waterfall to the agile paradigm by

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:57.385
slowly adopting components of agile into their waterfall process workflows.

00:02:57.385 --> 00:03:00.185
They may institute a daily scrum meeting,

00:03:00.185 --> 00:03:04.610
for example, or begin to organize efforts into biweekly sprints.

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.970
This intermediate step has been called wagile by some.

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.340
Often, wagile moves from initially reflecting

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.540
mostly waterfall concepts to a progressive adoption of

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.330
components of the agile paradigm until

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:25.690
project management increasingly resembles pure agile development.

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.410
In my own teams, I have managed towards a combination of the two in a way that

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:35.495
also follows from another goal setting strategy known as OKRs,

00:03:35.495 --> 00:03:38.255
or Objectives and Key Results.

00:03:38.255 --> 00:03:42.230
In my groups, we managed to four levels of goals.

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.140
At the highest level, goals,

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:51.040
efforts are organized broadly against the company's broad strategic objectives.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.495
Goals are measured via key results,

00:03:54.495 --> 00:03:59.165
measurable outcomes towards which our work is oriented to achieve.

00:03:59.165 --> 00:04:05.270
Key results are operationalized into the categories of effort required to achieve them.

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.120
These categories are known as epics,

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.060
a key unit of work in the agile framework.

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:16.895
Finally, epics are broken down into tasks that are assigned to task leaders.

00:04:16.895 --> 00:04:21.140
Tasks represent shorter term activities that can be completed in

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:27.150
one to two weeks by a single person or in some cases by a small team.
