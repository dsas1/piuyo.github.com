00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:05.080
The human capital component of data science is

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.665
critical to delivering on a data science strategy.

00:00:08.665 --> 00:00:12.475
Though universities are now launching data science programs,

00:00:12.475 --> 00:00:15.550
the large demand for data scientist well

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.160
outstrips the supply of graduates from such programs.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.400
Who then do we recruit,

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.075
hire, and train for our data science organization?

00:00:25.075 --> 00:00:30.500
How is that organization structured in order to deliver value to our business?

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.305
How do our data scientist carry out their work in a structured manner?

00:00:35.305 --> 00:00:38.350
How do we leverage data and data science to

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.185
foster a data-driven culture throughout the business.

00:00:41.185 --> 00:00:45.020
These are all questions addressed in this lesson.
