00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:05.130
Let's walk through an example of how to configure a team

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.805
and plan for the future using the data science heat map.

00:00:08.805 --> 00:00:11.610
This particular example comes from one of the teams

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.355
that I built from medium-sized organization,

00:00:14.355 --> 00:00:18.235
that was just starting out on its data science journey.

00:00:18.235 --> 00:00:23.130
Recall that the data science heat map specifies individuals involved in

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.410
data science initiatives according to

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.355
their specific roles and their levels of experience.

00:00:29.355 --> 00:00:34.190
In Year 1, my priority was building prototypes and delivering on

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:39.635
projects that gave quick wins in order to build momentum for the data science practice.

00:00:39.635 --> 00:00:45.065
I knew that I needed the most experience and expertise in my data science roles.

00:00:45.065 --> 00:00:49.880
As such, I filled two of my open FTEs with data scientists.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.310
One, a master data scientist who could lead many of the efforts of the team.

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.920
A second fellow level data scientist who was able to

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.555
independently lead many aspects of the initial prototypes.

00:01:01.555 --> 00:01:04.580
Our prototypes were embedded in machine learning,

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:10.120
so I needed a skilled machine-learning engineer who I hired at the fellow level.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:15.545
We built our data science projects into internally focused products.

00:01:15.545 --> 00:01:17.870
Fellow level professionals and data

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:23.525
visualization and software engineering also played key roles on that first year team.

00:01:23.525 --> 00:01:25.220
At this early stage,

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.845
I did not employ any additional adjunct roles.

00:01:27.845 --> 00:01:30.935
But I did have the stakeholders, the CEO,

00:01:30.935 --> 00:01:34.775
the Chief Data Officer and two functional heads,

00:01:34.775 --> 00:01:39.240
the Chief Marketing Officer and the Chief Technological Officer.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.600
In Year 2, I built on the momentum and enthusiasm that we have generated

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.685
in Year 1 to better fill out the team for developing hosting models in production.

00:01:49.685 --> 00:01:53.285
As such, I added two members to the team.

00:01:53.285 --> 00:01:56.810
The first was a fellow level data engineer who could build

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.620
professional grade ETL pipelines to bring data from

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:06.050
disparate silos throughout the organization directly to the point of analytics.

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:12.020
I also added a full stack engineer at the fellow level to the team whose role

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:18.130
was critical in building production quality applications with embedded data science.

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.370
Year 3 marked a major build-out of our data science footprint,

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.960
mainly through adjunct roles to support the work that was now in production.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.620
I added three apprentice level engineers to the team.

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.125
One, a full stack engineer,

00:02:33.125 --> 00:02:36.530
a second who specialized in front-end engineering,

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.250
and a third who specialized in back-end engineering.

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.240
I also added a fellow level UI/UX engineer,

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.180
as we were now working closely with customers to

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.915
get feedback that informed iterations of the product.

00:02:50.915 --> 00:02:54.905
As the team's operational scope grew more expansive,

00:02:54.905 --> 00:02:59.170
I added a fellow level product manager to manage activities.

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.300
Finally, as our product became open to

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.170
external customers who access the product through a web interface.

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.040
I contracted with a security engineer who was able to address

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.760
critical issues around maintaining the security of our product.
