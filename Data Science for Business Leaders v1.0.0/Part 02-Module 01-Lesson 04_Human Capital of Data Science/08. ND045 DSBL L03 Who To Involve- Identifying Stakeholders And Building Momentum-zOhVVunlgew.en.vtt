00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:06.585
As she launches data science initiatives in her organization,

00:00:06.585 --> 00:00:12.400
a wise leader will involve stakeholders throughout the organization.

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:16.500
Being able to discuss aspects of the project

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.545
that are relevant to various people throughout the business

00:00:19.545 --> 00:00:22.080
is one way to build credibility for

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.370
both the business leader and the data science initiative overall.

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:30.510
Stakeholders tend to be people with contextual knowledge of

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.800
the business who are closest to the operational goals of a data science project.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.145
In general, these break down into five separate categories.

00:00:40.145 --> 00:00:43.850
Perhaps the most important stakeholders are executives,

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.215
that is, the business leaders at the very top of the organization.

00:00:48.215 --> 00:00:50.825
This includes members of the C-suite,

00:00:50.825 --> 00:00:54.830
the CEO, the chief information officer,

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:57.065
the chief marketing officer,

00:00:57.065 --> 00:01:00.160
chief technology officer and so forth,

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.385
business unit leaders, and even possibly board members.

00:01:04.385 --> 00:01:09.005
Executive stakeholders should be included in every data science initiative.

00:01:09.005 --> 00:01:11.810
If you fail to establish a regular cadence

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.824
of updates with senior leaders such as the CEO,

00:01:14.824 --> 00:01:17.975
you may encounter unfortunate circumstances.

00:01:17.975 --> 00:01:22.430
In particular, the executive may forget about your project leading to

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.725
disaster if you need more funding or resources or if your project runs into problems.

00:01:27.725 --> 00:01:33.050
On the other hand, the CEO may begin to pester you and your team for status updates.

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:34.760
In the worst instances,

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:40.055
you'll find the CEO bypassing you altogether to talk to your team directly,

00:01:40.055 --> 00:01:44.110
which can create problems with your supervision and management.

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.800
Second, everybody involved in the day-to-day work to support

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.440
and execute data science initiatives includes data scientists,

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.665
data analysts, data engineers,

00:01:56.665 --> 00:02:00.700
analytics managers and directors, and so forth.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.990
Third are business stakeholders beyond the executive suite.

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.855
These include functional area heads,

00:02:07.855 --> 00:02:10.540
functional subject matter experts,

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:14.195
and individuals charged with customer service.

00:02:14.195 --> 00:02:18.625
Fourth are members of technological areas of the business.

00:02:18.625 --> 00:02:21.670
These include IT, architects,

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.230
programmers, or database administrators.

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.230
Finally, many projects have external stakeholders.

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:35.050
Customers or representatives of customers are members of client project teams.

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.335
By involving stakeholders early and often,

00:02:38.335 --> 00:02:41.530
a leader can generate enthusiasm and support for

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.110
the data science initiative and will be more likely to develop

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.170
data science projects that honor and reflect

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.165
the technical challenges specific to different areas of the business.

00:02:52.165 --> 00:02:56.330
Working with stakeholders can be challenging as people tend to be

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.880
motivated by different, sometimes conflicting objectives.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.000
The additional research section of this lesson includes an article I

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.200
like about working with stakeholders as a data scientist.
