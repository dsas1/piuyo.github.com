00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:06.780
The exercise directed you to identify the organizational model best suited for

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.230
the data science organization a business might need in order

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.695
to deliver on the roadmap completed in the last lesson.

00:00:14.695 --> 00:00:18.630
The organizational model most suited for the early days of

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.180
this business's data science journey is

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.920
a federated functional area lead data science organization.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.990
The two highest value projects to start with demand forecasting and

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.505
supply chain optimization are both procurement and supply chain projects.

00:00:36.505 --> 00:00:38.990
Starting the data science journey with

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:44.690
a functional data science model will allow the focus necessary to gain traction.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.990
As data science projects gain traction,

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.740
I would evolve the functional federated organization to

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:57.760
a more centralized federated model with strategic and operational responsibility,

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.060
resting with the chief data officer and functional areas and

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.760
business units managing data assets and data

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.059
science initiatives under strong central guidance.
