00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:03.660
In this lesson, we will consider

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:08.805
the organizational and talent issues that surround building a data science practice.

00:00:08.805 --> 00:00:11.700
Although data science human capital issues share

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.095
many characteristics of building teams and organizations in other technical areas,

00:00:17.095 --> 00:00:20.760
the distinct mix of skills and job requirements of

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.665
a data scientist introduce several considerations you need to data science.

00:00:25.665 --> 00:00:30.880
One of the particular challenges arises in sourcing data science candidates.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.734
Because data science specific degree programs are relatively new offering,

00:00:35.734 --> 00:00:38.285
we must look to other academic traditions,

00:00:38.285 --> 00:00:41.990
such as statistics, mathematics, computer science,

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:46.230
economics, physics for data science candidates.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.440
As we proceed through this lesson,

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.710
we will cover strategies specifically designed to meet

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:57.059
the challenges of staffing and managing a data science practice.
