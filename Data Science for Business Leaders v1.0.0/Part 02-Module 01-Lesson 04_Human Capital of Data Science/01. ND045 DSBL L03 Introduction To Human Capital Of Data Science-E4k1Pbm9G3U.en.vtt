00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:03.285
Up to this point,

00:00:03.285 --> 00:00:08.490
we've talked in depth about data science and how it fits within the business.

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.055
We now turn our attention to how to actually implement data science initiatives.

00:00:14.055 --> 00:00:17.115
We start with the question of human capital.

00:00:17.115 --> 00:00:22.394
How do we stand up a team to actually execute on data science initiatives?

00:00:22.394 --> 00:00:25.590
What processes do we implement so this team

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.590
efficiently and effectively carries out data science projects?

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:34.565
After this lesson, we will discuss another aspect of the implementation question.

00:00:34.565 --> 00:00:39.560
How to put in place the technical architecture to support data science initiatives.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:45.125
For now though, onward into the human capital of data science.

00:00:45.125 --> 00:00:47.795
Upon completion of this lesson,

00:00:47.795 --> 00:00:51.814
you should be able to successfully carry out the following tasks.

00:00:51.814 --> 00:00:55.070
Use the data science heat map as a tool for

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.855
specifying roles within the data science organization.

00:00:58.855 --> 00:01:05.225
Manage data science operations using structured processes for working communication.

00:01:05.225 --> 00:01:07.640
This includes project management,

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:14.390
structured problem-solving, synthesis, and storytelling in communicating the results.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.370
Given the particulars of a company's strategic and operating contexts,

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:20.690
you'll be able to identify

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.865
the data science organizational model best suited for that company.

00:01:24.865 --> 00:01:27.260
Given a data science strategy,

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.290
you will be able to identify and prioritize the mix of

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.435
roles you would pursue to build out the data science organization.

00:01:34.435 --> 00:01:38.719
You'll describe the project and product management strategies

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:43.405
best suited for a given company's data science organizations.

00:01:43.405 --> 00:01:46.130
Given a broad business challenge,

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.340
you'll be able to describe how you would approach the development of

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.260
a data science strategy using the structured problem-solving method.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.860
Finally, given a business context,

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.140
you'll be able to identify strategies for

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.350
promoting a data-driven culture throughout that business.

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.100
Particularly around guiding employees on how to think through

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.240
breaking down problems of identifying data consumers,

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.305
data needs and use cases, data sources,

00:02:15.305 --> 00:02:21.450
and related necessary pipelines and transformations that need to happen.
