00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:05.310
Companies have invested heavily in human capital and

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.460
technological architecture to become more data-driven.

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:13.665
This alone will not bring transformation to the business,

00:00:13.665 --> 00:00:16.650
in order to truly become a data-driven enterprise,

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.135
a company must take steps towards building a data-driven culture.

00:00:21.135 --> 00:00:24.675
In a 2020 article in the Harvard Business Review,

00:00:24.675 --> 00:00:28.215
David Waller outlined 10 commandments

00:00:28.215 --> 00:00:31.965
for helping a business's culture to become data-driven.

00:00:31.965 --> 00:00:36.870
I'd like to highlight a handful of these commandments in the spirit of helping you

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.460
identify strategies for promoting a data-driven culture in your own organization.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.360
The original article that contains

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.715
all ten commandments can be found at a link in the notes section of this lesson.

00:00:49.715 --> 00:00:52.445
The first commandment I'll highlight is,

00:00:52.445 --> 00:00:55.435
data-driven culture starts at the very top.

00:00:55.435 --> 00:00:59.825
Companies with data-driven cultures have senior executives who

00:00:59.825 --> 00:01:05.305
operate under the expectation that all actions be driven by data.

00:01:05.305 --> 00:01:08.715
The second commandment I'll highlight is,

00:01:08.715 --> 00:01:11.850
fix basic data access issues quickly.

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.010
One of the key factors that differentiates data-driven companies from

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.690
their peers is that employees in data-driven companies can access,

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.675
in fact, are required to access data from across the organization.

00:01:25.675 --> 00:01:28.580
This is not that common in business today.

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.280
One of the most common challenges I've seen in

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.030
the many organizations for which I've built data science practices,

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.330
is that most employees can at most access data

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.640
only within the virtual walls of their department or function.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.610
The third commandment I'll highlight is,

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.815
make proofs of concepts simple and robust,

00:01:48.815 --> 00:01:51.110
not fancy and brittle.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.280
We've discussed rapid prototyping early in the course.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.720
In the same spirit,

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.955
proofs of concepts that address manageable goals and are straightforward to implement,

00:02:01.955 --> 00:02:07.640
are favored over those that attempt to reach great heights or deliver on exotic goals,

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.925
but are technically complex.

00:02:09.925 --> 00:02:12.245
A fourth commandment is,

00:02:12.245 --> 00:02:17.315
don't unnecessarily limit your data scientists to data science.

00:02:17.315 --> 00:02:21.964
Though data scientists tend to focus on problems in their area of the business,

00:02:21.964 --> 00:02:25.850
the most effective data scientists grow into leadership positions,

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.215
having been exposed to issues and operations across the business.

00:02:30.215 --> 00:02:35.330
This broader perspective helps foster business acumen and the ability to see

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.300
novel ways that data science might be used

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.095
to address systemic challenges in the business.

00:02:42.095 --> 00:02:46.880
There are six more commandments included in the HBR article linked below.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.985
I recommend that you study the article and identify

00:02:49.985 --> 00:02:55.500
even more ways to promote a data-driven culture in your own organization.
