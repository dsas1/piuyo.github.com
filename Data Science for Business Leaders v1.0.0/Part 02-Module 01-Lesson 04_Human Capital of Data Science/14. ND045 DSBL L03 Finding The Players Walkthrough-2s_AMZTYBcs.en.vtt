00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:04.410
I'd like to walk through the process of finding

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.315
data science talent using an example from my own experience.

00:00:09.315 --> 00:00:13.200
When I joined Sears as Chief Data Scientist,

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.335
the first time I met the CEO, he told me,

00:00:16.335 --> 00:00:17.850
"When you come to me,

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.250
I want to talk about opportunities that are

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.735
at least $100 million margin or creative opportunities."

00:00:24.735 --> 00:00:30.900
At the time, my team consisted of the one remaining junior data scientist from

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:37.500
a converted economic modeling team and one member of Sears MBA rotational program,

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.150
a recent MBA whose current rotation was with my data science group.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.070
I needed to follow the guidance I read in

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.970
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Don't Panic.

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:56.045
I had to scale up fast and begun looking for people to join the team.

00:00:56.045 --> 00:00:59.974
Of course, the market was tight for these highly technical specialists,

00:00:59.974 --> 00:01:04.810
so I took full advantage of my network to try to find talent quickly.

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:07.760
In addition to traditional channels,

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.235
I found talent in the following places;

00:01:10.235 --> 00:01:15.470
A specialists data science consultancy provided several people.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:21.395
I brought in two more people who were on MBA rotational programs through Sears.

00:01:21.395 --> 00:01:27.125
I hired one person with an MBA in business analytics as an intern.

00:01:27.125 --> 00:01:30.320
I brought in three contractors that I had worked

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.000
with previously in a previous organization,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.260
and I filled in technical gaps with

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.710
team members from an offshore data science consultancy.

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.980
As you can see, I had to get quite creative to fill out

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.280
the project with the team members needed in short order.
