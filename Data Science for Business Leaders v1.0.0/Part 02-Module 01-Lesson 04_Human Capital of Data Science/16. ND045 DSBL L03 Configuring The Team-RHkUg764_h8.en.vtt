00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:04.830
As your data science initiative grows in scope,

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.830
it can be a challenge to maintain a high level view of

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.025
the specific roles of people on your data science team,

00:00:11.025 --> 00:00:16.515
the roles of people outside your data science team who nevertheless assist on projects,

00:00:16.515 --> 00:00:19.560
and your executive stakeholders.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.705
I use a tool called the Data Science Heatmap to do just that.

00:00:24.705 --> 00:00:28.620
The Data Science Heatmap specifies individuals involved in

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.505
data science initiatives according to their specific roles,

00:00:32.505 --> 00:00:36.420
their levels of expertise, and their experience.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.550
The Data Science Heatmap specifies roles at three levels of competency.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.280
The apprentice has limited experience,

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.080
and their focus tends to be on the job training.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.860
The apprentice understands terminology and basic principles of data science,

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.950
and how to access and use reference materials in the context of a data science project.

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.140
The fellow is an intermediate competency.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.295
The fellow is able to complete tasks in data science,

00:01:04.295 --> 00:01:07.465
but may need help from a master occasionally.

00:01:07.465 --> 00:01:12.199
Finally, the master competency can apply skills without assistance,

00:01:12.199 --> 00:01:14.510
and tends to be at the senior level.

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.915
The master is skilled at leading data science initiatives,

00:01:17.915 --> 00:01:23.030
and is a subject matter expert in the area represented by her specific role.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.775
Roles on the Data Science Heatmap are broken into three categories.

00:01:27.775 --> 00:01:31.970
First, core roles include the seven roles mentioned in

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.930
the building out the bench section of this lesson: the data scientist,

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.729
machine learning engineer, data analyst, data engineer,

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:45.199
data visualization engineer, software engineer,

00:01:45.199 --> 00:01:47.995
and the analytics translator.

00:01:47.995 --> 00:01:51.815
The second section includes adjunct roles,

00:01:51.815 --> 00:01:55.040
those outside the data science group who nevertheless make

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.200
key contributions towards carrying out the data science project.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.070
These include full-stack engineers,

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.310
front-end engineers, back-end engineers,

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:12.109
UI/UX engineers, business analysts, and security engineers.

00:02:12.109 --> 00:02:17.330
Finally, the third section includes the executive stakeholders for the project.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.565
These might include the CEO,

00:02:19.565 --> 00:02:21.455
the Chief Analytics Officer,

00:02:21.455 --> 00:02:23.365
the Chief Data Officer,

00:02:23.365 --> 00:02:28.499
business unit heads, and leaders of functional area units.
