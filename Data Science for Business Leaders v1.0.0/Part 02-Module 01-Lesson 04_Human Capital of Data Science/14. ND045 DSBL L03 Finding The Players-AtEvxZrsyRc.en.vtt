00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:06.585
Once you understand the skill sets that you need for your data science initiatives,

00:00:06.585 --> 00:00:09.000
look around your organization.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.360
You may find that other groups, departments,

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.055
or divisions may already have people with similar skills on staff.

00:00:17.055 --> 00:00:22.210
It may pay to take a chance on motivated talent that can be developed in-house.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.620
In this case, determine if it's appropriate to

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.580
upskill or reskill by promoting or retraining.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.930
It is often far less expensive to train someone who's already in

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.880
the organization than it is to find and hire a new talent.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.035
When hiring data scientists,

00:00:42.035 --> 00:00:45.005
you might consider candidates with PhD's.

00:00:45.005 --> 00:00:50.570
The rigorous training of a PhD program will help prepare these candidates for

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.270
the stress of working fast and furious to

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.825
find the patterns in data and explain how to put them to use.

00:00:56.825 --> 00:01:01.160
Moreover, you'll find that the cost difference between someone who has

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.795
completed a PhD and someone who has completed a master's degree,

00:01:05.795 --> 00:01:08.465
tends to be just 10-20 percent.

00:01:08.465 --> 00:01:10.580
This is a small price to pay for

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.960
an extra 3-4 years of training and education in data science.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.550
This isn't to say that you should only hire PhD's,

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.235
there are many other variables to consider during the hiring process.

00:01:22.235 --> 00:01:27.450
However, this should be a major input into your decision making process.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.410
The enthusiasm around data science can bring unreasonable time demands.

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.580
Managing these demands is something we've covered in a previous section.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.640
Nevertheless, a leader sometimes finds herself

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.775
faced with the need to staff a team in a hurry.

00:01:43.775 --> 00:01:47.600
People with data science related skills are in high demand,

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.850
so be creative and improvise.

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.995
Some areas you might consider include individual contractors,

00:01:54.995 --> 00:01:59.344
generalist consultancies, although they tend to be expensive,

00:01:59.344 --> 00:02:03.370
high-end boutique or specialists consultancies,

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:09.965
functional-specific consultancies, off-shore consultants,

00:02:09.965 --> 00:02:13.265
machine learning as a service,

00:02:13.265 --> 00:02:17.405
you may exploit company rotation programs,

00:02:17.405 --> 00:02:20.765
you may enlist technical recruiters,

00:02:20.765 --> 00:02:25.205
or you may rely on university or Boot Camp partnerships.

00:02:25.205 --> 00:02:28.730
Discuss your requirements and the urgency of your project

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.315
with the managers of other relevant groups within the organization.

00:02:32.315 --> 00:02:35.900
It's possible they have staff they cannot fully utilize

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.695
and maybe happy to loan them to you or even hand them over permanently.

00:02:39.695 --> 00:02:45.330
You may actually be doing them a favor by fully utilizing their team members.
