00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:03.910
We have come to the end of our lesson,

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:07.375
on the human capital of data science.

00:00:07.375 --> 00:00:10.570
We have discussed organizational models,

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.665
and how the data science function might be organized within the company.

00:00:14.665 --> 00:00:18.865
We've talked about identifying stakeholders and building momentum,

00:00:18.865 --> 00:00:22.810
as well as building the bench of data science professionals.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.450
We've discussed how to find the right people for

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:31.210
your data science team and how to configure that team using the data science heatmap.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.400
Once we have the people on board,

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.825
we need to have a process by which they carry out data science projects.

00:00:37.825 --> 00:00:41.830
To this end, we have discussed product management frameworks,

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.280
such as Agile, Waterfall,

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.535
and combinations of these methods.

00:00:46.535 --> 00:00:49.745
These will help structure your day-to-day activities,

00:00:49.745 --> 00:00:52.600
as you execute a data science initiative.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.510
We moved on to discussing tools for structured problem solving,

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.645
as well as Minto's and Schramm's frameworks,

00:00:59.645 --> 00:01:04.210
for synthesizing with actionable insights and storytelling with data.

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.540
Finally, we shared commandments for fostering a data-driven culture.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:14.375
Something that is key to an organization's ability to truly become data-driven.

00:01:14.375 --> 00:01:18.245
In the next lesson, we will discuss the technological infrastructure,

00:01:18.245 --> 00:01:21.965
that needs to be put in place to support data science initiatives.

00:01:21.965 --> 00:01:25.200
I look forward to seeing you there.
