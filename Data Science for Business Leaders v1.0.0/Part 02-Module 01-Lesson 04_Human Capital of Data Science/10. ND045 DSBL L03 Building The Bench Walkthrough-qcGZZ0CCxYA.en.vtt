00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:05.280
Let's say that executive leadership has allocated

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.885
eight full-time professional roles for a new data science organization.

00:00:09.885 --> 00:00:14.940
How might I organize these roles into teams within the organization?

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.810
If I had eight positions from my data science team,

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.800
I would organize my professionals into three groups to start.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.530
First, I would fill two project specific teams.

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:28.070
As their name suggests,

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.075
they would be deployed on individual projects from the roadmap.

00:00:32.075 --> 00:00:35.410
I would also keep a third group of specialists,

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:36.945
who at this stage,

00:00:36.945 --> 00:00:39.920
would float between the two project teams.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.265
My first team would be heavy on data scientists

00:00:43.265 --> 00:00:46.250
as the skill set associated with that role tends to be

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.950
able to complete many of the tasks critical on

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.765
the road to developing prototypes and proofs of concept.

00:00:52.765 --> 00:00:55.650
I would not hire only generalists; however,

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.540
a machine learning engineer would be a valuable specialist for

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.045
teams developing data science projects for which machine learning is key.

00:01:04.045 --> 00:01:08.805
I would probably keep the same structure for my second team as well.

00:01:08.805 --> 00:01:11.810
I would fill my last two positions with

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.230
a data engineer and a data visualization engineer.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.595
At this point, the goal is to develop working prototypes.

00:01:19.595 --> 00:01:24.860
I believe that data engineering and data visualization skills would not yet be in demand

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:30.740
enough to allocate full-time specialists in those areas to individual teams.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.600
Once our prototypes prove the concept and value of a data science solution,

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.560
they will be built into production quality products and applications,

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:45.240
at which point my specialist talent base will need to become much more deep.
