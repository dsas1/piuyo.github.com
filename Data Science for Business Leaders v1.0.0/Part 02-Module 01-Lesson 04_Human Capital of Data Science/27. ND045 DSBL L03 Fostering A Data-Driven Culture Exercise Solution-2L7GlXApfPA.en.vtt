00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:07.005
For this exercise, you were asked to detail six individual initiatives

00:00:07.005 --> 00:00:12.330
that you would recommend a business undertake in order to promote a data-driven culture.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.815
I will provide six example initiatives that I would personally recommend.

00:00:16.815 --> 00:00:21.375
Keep in mind that your answers may differ from those that I've presented.

00:00:21.375 --> 00:00:25.305
First, drive strategy from the top-down,

00:00:25.305 --> 00:00:28.560
engaging leadership all the way up to the C-suite,

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.075
will help you gain and maintain buy-in and support.

00:00:33.075 --> 00:00:37.725
Second, promote data and data science projects

00:00:37.725 --> 00:00:41.020
by over-communicating throughout the business.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:46.310
Liberally sharing the objectives and achievements of your data science initiatives,

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:50.410
will help infuse data science into the business culture.

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.130
Third, drive projects initially towards proof of concept,

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.825
rather than trying to fully solve the problem all at once.

00:00:58.825 --> 00:01:04.340
Proofs of concepts and prototypes allow you to maintain momentum with

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.620
incremental wins rather than risking

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.155
failure by driving towards a single massive solution.

00:01:11.155 --> 00:01:15.740
Fourth, encourage employees to get in the habit of asking

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.855
colleagues to provide data to support decisions or discussions.

00:01:20.855 --> 00:01:25.460
Employees should eventually naturally bring data to bear in

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:31.505
nearly all conversations to justify recommendations or provide a basis for action.

00:01:31.505 --> 00:01:39.155
Provide company wide access to core data via platforms such as Mode, Looker or Tableau.

00:01:39.155 --> 00:01:43.430
Platforms such as these go a long way towards democratizing data

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.995
access without requiring deep technical and programming skills.

00:01:47.995 --> 00:01:54.835
Finally, provide access to education and training modules through online platforms.

00:01:54.835 --> 00:01:58.520
Just-in-time training provides an efficient way to deliver

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:04.230
specific technical education in an intentional, precise manner.
