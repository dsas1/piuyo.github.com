00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:05.490
My years as a McKinsey management consultant taught me

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.285
to solve problems using a structured problem-solving method.

00:00:09.285 --> 00:00:11.610
To this day, I use aspects of

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.195
this method as a foundation for data science problem solving.

00:00:15.195 --> 00:00:20.155
In this section, I will introduce several tools for structured problem-solving.

00:00:20.155 --> 00:00:24.360
These will help you break down a problem into sub-components,

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.370
that can be addressed strategically in the course of a data science project.

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:35.745
The first of these is structuring hypothesis-driven projects using the MECE Framework.

00:00:35.745 --> 00:00:40.890
MECE stands for mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.405
When you are specifying the component parts of a problem,

00:00:44.405 --> 00:00:49.025
have you done so in a way that your specified components are independent?

00:00:49.025 --> 00:00:51.870
That is, they do not overlap.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.250
If so, we say they are mutually exclusive.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.420
Moreover, have you specified all possible components?

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.910
Do the components collectively cover all aspects of the problem?

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.985
If so, we say that it is collectively exhaustive.

00:01:07.985 --> 00:01:11.480
Using MECE as a guiding principle helps to

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.415
structure problems in a clean, comprehensive way.

00:01:15.415 --> 00:01:17.695
When structuring your problem,

00:01:17.695 --> 00:01:19.960
you break the problem into components.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.415
Those components can then be broken into sub-components and so forth,

00:01:24.415 --> 00:01:28.535
until you have actionable items at the very lowest level.

00:01:28.535 --> 00:01:34.630
This exercise can be represented using another problem-solving tool; the issue tree.

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.140
The issue tree can serve as a problem-solving map,

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.715
that will guide your data science project.

00:01:40.715 --> 00:01:45.850
Examples of issue trees are included in the note section of this lesson.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.595
Once you have your issue tree and the problem is broken down into its component parts,

00:01:51.595 --> 00:01:56.905
you need to prioritize your efforts towards the most valuable areas of examination.

00:01:56.905 --> 00:02:02.785
To do this, you can invoke the Pareto Principle or 80/20 rule.

00:02:02.785 --> 00:02:06.320
The 80/20 rule dictates that the greatest amount of

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.330
value tends to come from a small subset of the possible effort.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.420
In our context, we invoke the 80/20 rule

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.780
by identifying the areas that we should focus on,

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.130
that are most likely to bring

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.670
the greatest impact towards solving the data science problem.
