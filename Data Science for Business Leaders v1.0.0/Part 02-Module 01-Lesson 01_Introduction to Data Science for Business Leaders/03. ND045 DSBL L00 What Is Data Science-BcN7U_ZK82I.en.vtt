00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:06.420
Data science is one of the hottest areas of technology today.

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.714
What is data science?

00:00:08.714 --> 00:00:12.375
Simply put, data science is a field of inquiry

00:00:12.375 --> 00:00:16.485
that focuses on extracting meaningful insights from data.

00:00:16.485 --> 00:00:19.740
For our purposes, we will consider data science as

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.290
an umbrella term that includes the sub-fields of data analytics,

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.085
machine learning, and artificial intelligence.

00:00:28.085 --> 00:00:30.980
Success in data science generally require

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.715
some combination of business or domain expertise,

00:00:34.715 --> 00:00:37.805
knowledge of mathematics and statistics,

00:00:37.805 --> 00:00:40.840
and some degree of programming skills.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.235
Don't forget the soft skills.

00:00:43.235 --> 00:00:46.880
Successful data scientists are good communicators,

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.855
good storytellers, and good translators.

00:00:50.855 --> 00:00:53.480
They can communicate the art of the possible to

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.870
business leaders who may not have deep technical backgrounds.
