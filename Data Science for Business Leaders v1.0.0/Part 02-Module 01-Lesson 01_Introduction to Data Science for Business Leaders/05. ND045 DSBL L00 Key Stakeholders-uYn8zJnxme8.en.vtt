00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:04.500
When properly implemented and managed with

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.840
the right resources and good leadership with involvement of the right stakeholders,

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.625
even the most complex data science initiatives can go well.

00:00:14.625 --> 00:00:18.720
On the other hand, I've seen data science projects challenged because

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.770
leaders and stakeholders have unreasonable expectations.

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.729
Enlisting the support of key stakeholders and managing expectations

00:00:26.729 --> 00:00:31.170
appropriately are key to the success of a data science initiative.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.185
Who, are key stakeholders?

00:00:34.185 --> 00:00:39.050
Senior leadership should nearly always be included as a key stakeholder.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.455
It's especially important to engage the senior leader,

00:00:42.455 --> 00:00:45.080
generally the CEO, in backing

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.405
your initiative to bring success to your data science project.

00:00:49.405 --> 00:00:54.290
In larger organizations, a business unit head or functional head,

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.370
may serve as the senior leader in place of the CEO.

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:03.250
Functional area representatives should also be included as stakeholders.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.179
A data science project focused on marketing or finance, for example,

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:14.065
will need insights from specialists in those areas in order to deliver value.

00:01:14.065 --> 00:01:18.230
Technical area representatives, professionals from data,

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.965
DevOps or engineering also tend to be critical,

00:01:21.965 --> 00:01:27.190
especially if data and engineering needs will require their buy-in.

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.940
Finally, the voice of the customer should be represented whether by proxy through

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:38.190
the marketing department or through a specialized customer or client advisory group.
