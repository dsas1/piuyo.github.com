Hello and welcome to the Data Science for Business Leaders course.

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.280
My name is Ed Wiley,

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.070
I'm a career machine learning expert with

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.140
extensive experience in research, academia, and industry.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.680
I studied with some of the pioneers in machine learning during

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.430
my doctoral degree at Stanford University and spent

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.490
the better part of a decade as chair of a doctoral program in

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.020
social science research methods at the University of Colorado at Boulder,

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:36.715
where my courses focused on advanced applied statistics and quantitative methods.

00:00:36.715 --> 00:00:38.990
I have over 20 years of

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.435
experience building data science teams

00:00:41.435 --> 00:00:44.270
and leading data science initiatives across companies,

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.055
both large and small.

00:00:46.055 --> 00:00:49.130
I built the first big data analytics team at

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.780
Seagate and served as chief data scientist for Sears and Kmart.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.870
I've also built machine learning teams from scratch for

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.590
startups such as Nurx and Enveda therapeutics.

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.220
I often keynote and present workshops on data science at

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.530
conferences and have written and

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.905
published a book on implementing artificial intelligence,

00:01:09.905 --> 00:01:13.565
data science, and machine learning into the business,

00:01:13.565 --> 00:01:18.075
entitled "Artificial Intelligence: from Buzzword to Business Function".

00:01:18.075 --> 00:01:22.640
I'm an evangelist for the field of data science and a good degree of my work

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.865
goes towards raising the profile of the field and those that work in it.

00:01:26.865 --> 00:01:29.660
In fact, all profits from my book are

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.900
being directed to support programs that foster interest in

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.900
data science as a career among women and

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.090
individuals from backgrounds traditionally under-represented in the field.

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.495
I'm delighted that you've joined me here,

00:01:42.495 --> 00:01:47.600
and I hope that I can share some of the lessons learned in my own data science career so

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.880
that you too may implement data science initiatives in your own business.
