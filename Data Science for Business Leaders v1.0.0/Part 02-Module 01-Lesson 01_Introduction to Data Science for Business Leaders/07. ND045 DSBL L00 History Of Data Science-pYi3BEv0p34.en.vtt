00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:05.160
Although data science, artificial intelligence,

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.735
and machine learning have risen to prominence over the last decade,

00:00:09.735 --> 00:00:12.300
the mathematical and philosophical roots of

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.110
these technologies date back to the middle of the last century.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.860
Data science has seen several booms and winters with

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.490
cycles alternating as hype and excitement rises,

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:32.170
and then inevitably falls as realized value fails to reach its lofty expectations.

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.760
Many of the machine learning techniques in use

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.970
today were originally proposed decades ago,

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.570
but have only become feasible in practice as computing power has

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.370
increased and computing costs have decreased.

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.450
Data science as a field followed on initial excitement around big data and has

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:56.400
since matured to hold a sustaining role across industry and research today.
