We will rely on a variety of tools to complete the exercises in this course.

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.680
As you complete exercises in the Capstone project,

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:17.010
we will introduce slides and documents typical of office productivity software.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.420
This will allow you at the end of the course to keep the materials you

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.025
generate so you may use them in the future in your professional role.

00:00:26.025 --> 00:00:29.865
Data science for business leaders is not a technical course,

00:00:29.865 --> 00:00:36.670
so we will not be directly interacting with any coding or development environment.
