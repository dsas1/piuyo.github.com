00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:04.890
This course consists of four lessons that

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.310
together cover data science and its business case,

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:10.400
as well as the processes, people,

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.870
and platforms necessary to execute data science initiatives for the business.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.300
Businesses often suspect that they want

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.670
data science capabilities and may even sense a need for data science capabilities,

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.460
but many are not sure where to start.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.875
What is data science?

00:00:28.875 --> 00:00:31.320
Who is a data scientist?

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.380
What is possible through data science?

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.835
All these questions are addressed in the principles of data science lesson,

00:00:39.835 --> 00:00:45.500
which provides a broad introduction to data science and what it can do for a business.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.165
Creating a data science strategy is not a stand-alone activity,

00:00:50.165 --> 00:00:54.770
it must be driven by your overarching business operations and strategy.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:00.800
Therefore, a critical starting point for any data strategy is articulation of

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.920
a business' strategic objectives in

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.210
identification of opportunities for data science-based transformation.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.680
These are the topics of the business case for data science lesson.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.860
The human capital component of data science is

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.355
critical to delivering on a data science strategy.

00:01:19.355 --> 00:01:21.650
Who do we recruit, hire,

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.590
and train for our data science organization?

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.810
How is that organization structured in order to deliver value to our business?

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:35.020
How do our data scientists carry out their work in a structured manner?

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.600
How do we leverage data and data science

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.425
to foster a data-driven culture throughout the business?

00:01:42.425 --> 00:01:48.070
These questions are addressed in the human capital for data science lesson.

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:53.525
Finally, executing the data science strategy requires technology.

00:01:53.525 --> 00:01:57.580
Technology for data and technology for machine learning.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.125
Technology needs are specific to each business.

00:02:01.125 --> 00:02:05.345
They depend on the types of data to be leveraged for data science,

00:02:05.345 --> 00:02:08.105
the form and magnitude of that data,

00:02:08.105 --> 00:02:12.725
the types of data science models that a business plans to create,

00:02:12.725 --> 00:02:18.215
and the overall scale of operations represented by those data science models.

00:02:18.215 --> 00:02:21.920
The technical infrastructure lesson covers in

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.249
great detail the parameters that must be considered,

00:02:25.249 --> 00:02:29.450
both in creating a data and data architecture strategy and in

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:35.040
building a machine learning architecture to support data science initiatives.
