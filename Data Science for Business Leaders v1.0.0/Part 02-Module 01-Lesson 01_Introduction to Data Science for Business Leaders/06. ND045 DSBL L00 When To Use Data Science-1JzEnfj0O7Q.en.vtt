00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:05.190
We will discuss the key conditions for success in

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.300
data science initiatives extensively throughout the course.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.630
Nominally, data science is a candidate tool for

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.245
any problem for which there's data to support insight.

00:00:16.245 --> 00:00:21.390
Data Science initiatives need not employ the most modern and complicated of models.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.940
Often straightforward analytics provide

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.940
tremendous value and have

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.674
the added benefit of being relatively straightforward to implement.

00:00:29.674 --> 00:00:33.620
In general, data science initiatives are most appropriate

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.180
when data to support the initiative is available and accessible.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.970
When the initiative aligns with the strategic priorities of the organization.

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:49.309
When the organization has the right human capital to carry out the initiative.

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:51.110
When the organization has

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.920
the right technical architecture in place to support the initiative.
