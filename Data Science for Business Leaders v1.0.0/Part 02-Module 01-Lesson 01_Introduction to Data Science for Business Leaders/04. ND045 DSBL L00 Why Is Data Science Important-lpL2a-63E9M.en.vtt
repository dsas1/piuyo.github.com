Data science is seeing widespread adoption in business today.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.530
A 2020 survey by the analyst firm Cognilytica,

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.690
revealed that nearly 90 percent of respondents indicated that they will have some sort

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.465
of in-progress artificial intelligence implementation within the next two years.

00:00:21.465 --> 00:00:27.285
That said, knowing just how to implement data science is critical.

00:00:27.285 --> 00:00:30.960
According to McKinsey in 2019,

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.555
86 percent of executives say their organizations have been at best,

00:00:36.555 --> 00:00:38.910
only somewhat effective at meeting

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.459
the primary objective of their data and analytics programs.

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:48.990
Including more of one-quarter of whom say that these programs have been ineffective.
