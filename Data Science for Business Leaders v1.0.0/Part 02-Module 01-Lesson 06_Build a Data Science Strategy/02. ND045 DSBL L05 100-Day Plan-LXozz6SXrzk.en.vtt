00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:04.890
The capstone project is centered around creating

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.910
a 100-day plan for launching a new data science initiative.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.295
Upon assuming a new leadership role within a company,

00:00:14.295 --> 00:00:18.300
whether from an internal move or from joining the company anew,

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.490
it is common for an executive to be asked to

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.580
prepare a plan for their first 100 days in the job.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.330
Such a plan gives an opportunity for a new leader to set

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.730
strategic priorities regarding the structures and

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.060
culture she would like her organization to adopt,

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.695
to set out a human capital plan for building and leading the organization,

00:00:37.695 --> 00:00:41.510
and to specify an initial roadmap of projects upon

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.710
which the organization will focus in its initial operations.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.770
You will use two templates we've provided to

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.360
complete the activities associated with the capstone project.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.950
The first template is this document,

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.985
which models the various activities we've completed to help you organize

00:00:58.985 --> 00:01:04.265
all the relevant information required of the individual parts of the capstone project.

00:01:04.265 --> 00:01:10.310
You will use this information to create your 100-day plan using the second template,

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.540
a slide deck presentation that you'll be giving to your CEO

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.710
in what essentially will serve as a pitch deck for your 100-day plan.
