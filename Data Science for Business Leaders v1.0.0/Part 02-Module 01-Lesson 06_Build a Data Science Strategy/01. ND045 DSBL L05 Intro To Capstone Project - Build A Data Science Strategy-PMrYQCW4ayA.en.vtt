00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.669
We have arrived at the conclusion of the course.

00:00:05.669 --> 00:00:08.640
At this point, you should be prepared to complete

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.105
the data science for business leaders Capstone Project.

00:00:12.105 --> 00:00:15.585
Upon assuming a new leadership role within a company,

00:00:15.585 --> 00:00:19.665
whether from an internal move or joining the company and new,

00:00:19.665 --> 00:00:22.770
it is common for an executive to be asked to

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.000
prepare a plan for the first 100 days in the job.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.820
The Capstone Project has you prepare

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.825
that 100 day data science plan for a company of your choosing.

00:00:33.825 --> 00:00:39.210
This could be your current company or some other existing business.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.150
As part of this project,

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:42.740
you will build the following.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:47.615
You will identify six data science opportunities for the organization.

00:00:47.615 --> 00:00:51.950
You will complete a rack and stack evaluation of these opportunities,

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.380
detailing the risks, challenges,

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.075
and key factors for success for each of the opportunities,

00:00:58.075 --> 00:01:03.440
and completing a road map for executing these six data science opportunities.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.440
You will complete the human capital plan for the data science organization,

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.695
and you will complete the technical plan for the data science organization,

00:01:12.695 --> 00:01:18.890
including the data in data architecture strategy and machine learning architecture.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.870
The work product for this Capstone Project will be a detailed presentation to

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:29.260
the CEO detailing your plan and the rationale behind your decisions.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.350
Upon completion of this Capstone Project,

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.485
you will be able to carry out the following tasks.

00:01:35.485 --> 00:01:37.925
Given a business context,

00:01:37.925 --> 00:01:39.980
you'll be able to generate ideas for

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.680
data science projects across multiple functional areas of the business.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.925
You'll be able to determine the relative strategic importance, cost,

00:01:49.925 --> 00:01:53.269
complexity of implementation, risk,

00:01:53.269 --> 00:01:55.505
likelihood of value capture,

00:01:55.505 --> 00:01:59.870
and magnitude of benefit for each of a variety of projects.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.740
You'll be able to identify and prioritize the mix of roles you

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.625
would pursue to build out a data science organization.

00:02:07.625 --> 00:02:11.030
You will be able to prepare a detailed data and

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.790
data architecture strategy that a business can

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.705
use to carry out the road map of data science projects.

00:02:17.705 --> 00:02:21.290
Finally, you'll be able to generate strategies for

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.290
promoting a data-driven culture for your business.
