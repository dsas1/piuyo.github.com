00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.250
Hi, I'm Richie Benoit.

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:03.315
I'm Richard Kalehoff.

00:00:03.315 --> 00:00:04.305
I'm Vienna Harvey.

00:00:04.305 --> 00:00:08.820
I'm Bryan Okeke and I'm a curriculum manager and self-taught full-stack developer.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.450
I manage our self-driving car here at Udacity.

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:13.830
I'm a content creator and software engineer.

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.910
Here at Udacity, I've been developing programs in data science.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.110
Learning a new skill can be really exciting but can also be challenging,

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.545
especially in a self-paced online program.

00:00:25.545 --> 00:00:28.770
We start by defining a learning path so that we know

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.130
what our goals are and that we're making progress towards them.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.880
A goal can mean to finish a particular course

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.450
or complete a nanodegree program and get a new job.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.160
Maybe you're just personally curious about

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.320
a topic and you want to broaden your knowledge base.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.775
Whatever your goal is,

00:00:43.775 --> 00:00:45.200
try to keep it in mind.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.955
It shapes how you learn.

00:00:46.955 --> 00:00:48.650
When it comes to goals,

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:53.420
one strategy is to set short-term goals and long-term goals.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.235
If your goal is to complete a project or apply to a certain job,

00:00:58.235 --> 00:01:02.090
then you should write an incremental plan to get there.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.910
Knowing specific steps to take or milestones to

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.985
reach can help you stay on track and not feel overwhelmed.

00:01:07.985 --> 00:01:10.730
Tick each step as you achieve it so you can

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.625
see yourself moving closer to your long-term goals.

00:01:13.625 --> 00:01:17.350
Keeping yourself accountable to a goal is really important.

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.545
Seriously, so important.

00:01:19.545 --> 00:01:22.340
Set calendar reminders for yourself to keep yourself

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.090
accountable and learn some small thing every day.

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.160
Try to add an additional layer of

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.025
accountability by telling a partner or a friend about it,

00:01:31.025 --> 00:01:32.955
or even your co-worker or a boss,

00:01:32.955 --> 00:01:34.745
someone who can check on your progress.

00:01:34.745 --> 00:01:40.285
Enroll in a program with a buddy to help you stay committed to completing the program.

00:01:40.285 --> 00:01:42.950
Study show it takes time to form a new habit.

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.725
So get into the habit of working on your program.

00:01:45.725 --> 00:01:47.270
Once learning becomes a habit,

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.380
it won't take so much effort to sit down and work on your program.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.425
When you feel like procrastinating,

00:01:52.425 --> 00:01:55.580
remind yourself why you enrolled in the program in the first place.

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:56.890
To help motivate you.

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.870
Then reward yourself when you stick with the habit.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.270
I like to get myself an ice cream cone.

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.450
Having a plan and checking off smaller items makes

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.830
the larger task of learning a whole new skill seem a bit more approachable.

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.660
You can even set a goal of finishing one exercise or part of the lesson in one sitting.

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.000
The Udacity classroom has projects and

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.940
suggested project deadlines that you can use as well.

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.989
While these projects have good milestones, more importantly,

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:29.675
they provide hands-on learning to actively practice the skills that you've learned.

00:02:29.675 --> 00:02:33.005
Now, these projects are meant to be challenging.

00:02:33.005 --> 00:02:35.360
I know it can be frustrating to get stuck in

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.640
the middle of a project that is really difficult.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.520
But those times are often the ones where there's

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.714
more room for exploration and innovation.

00:02:46.714 --> 00:02:48.815
Build on things incrementally.

00:02:48.815 --> 00:02:51.920
Everyone struggles a bit when they learn something new.

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.560
Be patient with yourself.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.240
For example, software programmers in the industry

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.210
have taken several years to become masters in their domain.

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:02.209
So remind yourself of your goal and remember,

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:06.875
every step is getting you closer to it. Let's summarize.

00:03:06.875 --> 00:03:09.170
Set goals for yourself and hold yourself

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.245
accountable with a schedule or an accountability buddy.

00:03:12.245 --> 00:03:14.960
Breakdown projects into small goals.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.980
Work on incremental parts of the lesson.

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.960
Work through exercises to make the learning stick.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.480
You've got this, so good luck.

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:24.440
Happy learning.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.370
Happy learning.

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:26.195
Happy learning.

00:03:26.195 --> 00:03:27.930
Happy learning.
