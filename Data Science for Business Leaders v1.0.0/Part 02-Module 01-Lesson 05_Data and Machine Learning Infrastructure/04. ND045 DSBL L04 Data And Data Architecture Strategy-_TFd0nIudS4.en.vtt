00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:07.510
We now turn our attention to the data and the architecture needed to support that data,

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:09.865
for data science initiatives.

00:00:09.865 --> 00:00:11.920
In the planning process,

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:17.604
it is wise to craft a data and data architecture strategy for the business.

00:00:17.604 --> 00:00:22.360
This strategy includes five components that together guide

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.115
the leader regarding how to plan for the use of data within the organization,

00:00:27.115 --> 00:00:30.250
especially for data science initiatives.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.430
The first component is data requirements.

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.915
What data should be included in the data strategy?

00:00:37.915 --> 00:00:42.945
Just because you have identified data across all parts of the business,

00:00:42.945 --> 00:00:44.900
does not mean that all of that should be

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.890
prioritized for initial inclusion in the data strategy.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.715
You will need to create ETL pipelines from

00:00:52.715 --> 00:00:55.415
individual data platforms through the company

00:00:55.415 --> 00:00:59.165
in order to bring any data to the point of analytics.

00:00:59.165 --> 00:01:01.730
These pipelines can be complex,

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:07.640
so it is wise to focus on only the most necessary components at the very beginning.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:14.765
The second component of the data and data architecture strategy concerns data governance.

00:01:14.765 --> 00:01:18.025
How will we promote data availability?

00:01:18.025 --> 00:01:21.140
Who will be given access to the data?

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.755
What can we do to make the data more usable to the end-user?

00:01:25.755 --> 00:01:29.065
How do we guarantee data integrity?

00:01:29.065 --> 00:01:33.250
Finally, how do we ensure data security?

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.360
These are aspects of a data governance strategy which serve as

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.050
a second component of the data and data architecture strategy.

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.640
Third is the technology component which

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.150
identifies the components of your data architecture.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:55.790
Are you storing data in a data lake or via a relational or non-relational database?

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:01.615
Are you accessing that data directly or through API endpoints?

00:02:01.615 --> 00:02:04.390
These are technology questions that make up

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.455
the third component to the data and data architecture strategy.

00:02:08.455 --> 00:02:12.145
The fourth component is skills and capacity.

00:02:12.145 --> 00:02:14.590
How do you promote development of

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.180
data literacy skills and capacity throughout the organization?

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.575
Do you plan to provide company-wide training or is training more targeted?

00:02:24.575 --> 00:02:27.475
Is it offered on a regular basis,

00:02:27.475 --> 00:02:30.560
or is it available just in time?

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.775
How are data updates published throughout the company?

00:02:34.775 --> 00:02:38.500
Finally, the fifth component of a data and

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.790
data architecture strategy is support for machine learning.

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.350
What are the machine learning components of the architecture?

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.770
How does it interface with the data architecture?

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:57.545
In the last section, we discussed three alternatives for data science initiatives.

00:02:57.545 --> 00:03:00.725
Fully built and maintained in house,

00:03:00.725 --> 00:03:05.445
hosted via managed services using Cloud service providers,

00:03:05.445 --> 00:03:08.675
in reliance on commercial solutions.

00:03:08.675 --> 00:03:11.210
These are the three alternatives that make up

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:16.410
the machine learning component to the data and data architecture strategy.
