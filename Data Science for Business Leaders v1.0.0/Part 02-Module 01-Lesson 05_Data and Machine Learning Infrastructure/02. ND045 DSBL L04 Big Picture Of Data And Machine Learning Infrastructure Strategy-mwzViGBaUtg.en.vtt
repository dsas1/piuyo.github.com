00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:05.865
Executing the data science strategy requires technology,

00:00:05.865 --> 00:00:11.415
technology specific to data and technology specific to machine learning.

00:00:11.415 --> 00:00:14.730
Technology needs are specific to each business.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.580
These needs depend on the types of data to be leveraged for data science,

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.700
the form and magnitude of that data,

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.214
the types of data science models that a business plans to create,

00:00:28.214 --> 00:00:33.510
and the overall scale of operations represented by those data science models.

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.355
In order to successfully execute data science initiatives,

00:00:37.355 --> 00:00:39.930
a business must develop a formal data and

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.675
data architecture strategy that addresses support for machine learning.

00:00:44.675 --> 00:00:48.500
This lesson covers the parameters that must be considered,

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.920
both in creating a data and data architecture strategy,

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.600
and the machine-learning architecture needed to support data science initiatives.
