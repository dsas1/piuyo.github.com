00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:05.715
For this exercise, the businesses executive leadership

00:00:05.715 --> 00:00:09.915
would like to better understand aspects of data governance.

00:00:09.915 --> 00:00:13.425
For each of several questions regarding data governance,

00:00:13.425 --> 00:00:16.740
you were to provide one example policy or

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.005
initiative that would support data science projects in the production function.

00:00:22.005 --> 00:00:26.745
I have provided two sample responses for each of the questions post.

00:00:26.745 --> 00:00:31.395
Your responses may differ from mine, which is just fine.

00:00:31.395 --> 00:00:33.900
The first question was,

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.800
how might the businesses production function promote data availability?

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.400
My responses are as follows: All employees could be given

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:49.325
read access to the data both directly and via platform, such as mode.

00:00:49.325 --> 00:00:55.385
Training could be provided on an as needed basis through online resources.

00:00:55.385 --> 00:00:57.800
The second question was,

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.155
how might the businesses production function promote usability?

00:01:02.155 --> 00:01:06.050
First, comprehensive data dictionaries can guide

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.520
employees with regard to what data is available and how it is represented.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.970
Second, a single source of truth data in

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.375
the warehouse can be supplemented with categories,

00:01:17.375 --> 00:01:21.625
tags, and indexes to promote usability.

00:01:21.625 --> 00:01:24.095
The third question was,

00:01:24.095 --> 00:01:28.630
how might the businesses production function guarantee integrity?

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.470
First, checks could be built into ETL processes to

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.945
ensure that data accuracy is maintained as it is moved into the data warehouse.

00:01:38.945 --> 00:01:45.065
Second, tracing steps can be built in so that any process is repeatable,

00:01:45.065 --> 00:01:49.220
which will aid root cause analysis when things go wrong.

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.045
Finally, question number four was,

00:01:53.045 --> 00:01:58.030
how might the businesses production function guaranteed data security?

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.760
First, it would be wise to train employees with

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.880
respect to proper methods for data handling,

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.300
data access, and data storage.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.380
Second, all data should be maintained within

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.400
the firewall except when passed to the machine learning architecture.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:23.280
At which point, you should guarantee encryption of that data both at rest and in motion.
