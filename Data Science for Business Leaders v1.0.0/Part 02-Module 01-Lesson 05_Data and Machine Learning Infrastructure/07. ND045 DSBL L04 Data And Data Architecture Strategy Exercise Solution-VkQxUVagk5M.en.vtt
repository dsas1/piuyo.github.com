00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:06.480
This exercise had you consider a company's production function,

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.405
the business area in charge of manufacturing of products or delivery of services.

00:00:12.405 --> 00:00:15.870
If business's executive leadership wants to understand

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.040
aspects of data and data architecture strategy and has

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.740
tasked you with identifying the components of

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.260
a data architecture that could support

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.495
data science initiatives in the production function.

00:00:28.495 --> 00:00:30.604
In the pages that follow,

00:00:30.604 --> 00:00:33.530
I outline the components of a data architecture

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.070
that I would recommend for the business's production function.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.845
Your answers may differ from mine.

00:00:39.845 --> 00:00:42.530
What is important is that you address all of

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.475
the key aspects of each of the five components.

00:00:46.475 --> 00:00:51.425
Because this exercise explicitly focuses on the production function,

00:00:51.425 --> 00:00:55.820
our data strategy will start with a focus on manufacturing.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.595
This will require the central collection of

00:00:58.595 --> 00:01:02.590
all manufacturing data into a single data warehouse.

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.650
ETL will be required from individual test platforms,

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.830
machines sensor platforms, and machine monitoring applications.

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:17.135
A relational database in the data warehouse will make the most sense to start,

00:01:17.135 --> 00:01:19.940
as this provides a straightforward basis for

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.435
providing data to machine learning applications.

00:01:23.435 --> 00:01:28.290
Data governance concerns availability, usability,

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.220
integrity, and security of data and data systems.

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.280
All employees in manufacturing should be given read access to

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:43.055
the data both directly and via platforms such as Looker or Tableau.

00:01:43.055 --> 00:01:49.515
Training will be provided on an as-needed basis through online resources.

00:01:49.515 --> 00:01:53.080
Comprehensive data dictionaries should guide employees with

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.655
regard to what data is available and how it is represented.

00:01:57.655 --> 00:02:04.090
The single source of truth data in the warehouse should be supplemented with categories,

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.180
tags, and indexes to promote usability.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:12.310
Checks should be built in the ETL processes to ensure that

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.680
data accuracy is maintained as it is moved into the data warehouse.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.435
Tracing steps should be built in so that any process is repeatable,

00:02:22.435 --> 00:02:26.365
which will aid root cause analysis when things go wrong.

00:02:26.365 --> 00:02:29.170
Employees should be trained with respect to

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.800
proper methods for data handling and data storage.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.160
They should maintain all data within the firewall,

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.175
except when passed to the machine-learning architecture,

00:02:39.175 --> 00:02:44.840
at which point data should be encrypted at rest and in motion.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.190
To support data architecture technology,

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.985
we recognize that source data exist throughout the company.

00:02:51.985 --> 00:02:59.015
ETL processes should bring that source data into a single source of truth data store.

00:02:59.015 --> 00:03:04.150
That data store should be supplemented with tags to increase usability.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.025
Employees will access that data store through a SQL inquiry engine,

00:03:09.025 --> 00:03:15.885
either directly or through a business intelligence application such as Mode or Power BI.

00:03:15.885 --> 00:03:19.160
The machine learning architecture will communicate with

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:25.085
the data architecture via either API endpoints or direct upload.

00:03:25.085 --> 00:03:28.880
With regard to promoting data skills and capacity,

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.480
I recommend that the company provide just-in-time training for

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:38.075
employees to develop skills related to data analysis and data science.

00:03:38.075 --> 00:03:44.065
The business should promote a culture of data-driven exploration and experimentation,

00:03:44.065 --> 00:03:48.860
should publish information about data updates organization-wide,

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:55.210
and should promote and reward examples of employees who undertake data-driven projects.

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:58.220
At the outset, machine learning will be done on

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.210
individual computers within the organization's firewall.

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:07.045
This should be sufficient for the proof of concept stage for the first project.

00:04:07.045 --> 00:04:09.725
Once greater computing power is needed,

00:04:09.725 --> 00:04:14.285
the business can spin up a machine learning architecture in a public cloud environment,

00:04:14.285 --> 00:04:16.610
such as Amazon Web Services,

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:20.675
Google Cloud Platform, or Microsoft Azure.

00:04:20.675 --> 00:04:24.230
This will allow production quality experimentation,

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:28.070
model training, and model deployment to management.

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.000
Applications that rely on machine learning can communicate

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.450
with machine learning architecture through API endpoints.
