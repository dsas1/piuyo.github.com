00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:06.779
A data science architecture can be thought of consisting of three layers.

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.555
The first of these is the data layer.

00:00:09.555 --> 00:00:15.675
This includes the data and data architecture used to bring data to the point of analysis.

00:00:15.675 --> 00:00:21.330
In many cases, this involves only the original sources of data throughout the company,

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.320
but also ETL or extract, transform,

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.720
and load pipelines that are

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.665
specifically set up to bring the data to the point of analysis.

00:00:31.665 --> 00:00:35.385
That point of analysis typically accesses data via

00:00:35.385 --> 00:00:39.700
a data lake or relational or non-relational database.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.465
The point of analysis represents a second layer, the analysis layer.

00:00:44.465 --> 00:00:46.400
The analysis layer represents

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.890
the machine-learning architecture to support analytics and machine learning tasks.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.360
In many cases, the analysis layer is accessed via

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.745
a user layer that provides a development environment in R or Python.

00:01:01.745 --> 00:01:05.900
The two programming languages most common to data science.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.315
Depending on the end-user,

00:01:08.315 --> 00:01:10.820
and whether the data science functionality will be

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.960
built into existing products or solutions,

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:20.755
the user layer may include a front-end environment tailored to specific use cases.

00:01:20.755 --> 00:01:23.450
As we discussed in this lesson,

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.000
there are three broad alternatives for how to host

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.120
data and machine learning technology in a business.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.580
In many of today's largest companies,

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.880
it is common for the data science architecture to be deployed,

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.485
hosted, and maintained entirely in-house.

00:01:39.485 --> 00:01:44.630
Companies that do not have the key technical skills to build, deploy,

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.045
and maintain an in-house solution,

00:01:47.045 --> 00:01:51.440
can leverage public cloud providers for hosting and deployment.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.630
Managed services provided by

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.335
public cloud providers provide many of the data architecture,

00:01:57.335 --> 00:01:59.960
security, and monitoring services

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.040
necessary for data and machine learning architecture management.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.870
Providing an alternative well-suited for the organization that does not have

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:14.195
the internal expertise to maintain its own solutions in house.

00:02:14.195 --> 00:02:18.845
Finally, for organizations with little development expertise,

00:02:18.845 --> 00:02:21.110
data science is still possible through

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.905
commercial solutions such as Software as a Service,

00:02:24.905 --> 00:02:27.960
or Machine Learning as a Service providers.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:33.260
For these companies, an off-the-shelf solution is preferable to building and maintaining

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:39.240
the infrastructure to support data science either internally or via a public cloud.
