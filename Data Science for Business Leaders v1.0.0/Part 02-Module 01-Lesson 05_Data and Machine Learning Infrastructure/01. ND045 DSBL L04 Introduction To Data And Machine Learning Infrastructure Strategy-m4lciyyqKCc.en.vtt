00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:07.260
Welcome to the next lesson on data and machine learning infrastructure.

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.679
To this point, you've learned about data science,

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.555
how it fits into the business,

00:00:12.555 --> 00:00:17.050
and how to staff and manage data science initiatives.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.450
This lesson provides the final piece of the puzzle.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:26.970
The technical infrastructure needed to support a business's data science initiatives.

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.090
After this lesson, you will be prepared to complete

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.205
the capstone project of building a business's data science strategy.

00:00:35.205 --> 00:00:37.830
Upon completion of this lesson,

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:42.165
you'll be able to successfully carry out the following tasks.

00:00:42.165 --> 00:00:45.320
Given a particular business context,

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.135
you'll prepare a detailed data and data architecture strategy.

00:00:50.135 --> 00:00:52.940
You'll also be able to detail how

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.700
a machine learning architecture strategy fits

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.710
into the business's data and data architecture strategy.

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.680
Finally, you'll be able to identify the strengths and

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.960
weaknesses of a given businesses data and data architecture strategy.
