00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:06.810
We have come to the end of our lesson on the technology of data science.

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.700
The final lesson of the data science for business leaders course.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.290
We've discussed the three layers of a data science architecture.

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:22.995
The components of a data and data architecture strategy in training data bias.

00:00:22.995 --> 00:00:27.960
Finally, we've covered key determinants of which direction to go on

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.060
the build versus buy decision for how to host your machine learning architecture.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.235
All that remains in the course is to complete the Capstone project,

00:00:37.235 --> 00:00:42.310
in which you will develop your own data science strategy for a company of your choosing.

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:46.100
The next section will describe that activity in detail,

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.960
I wish you the best of luck.
