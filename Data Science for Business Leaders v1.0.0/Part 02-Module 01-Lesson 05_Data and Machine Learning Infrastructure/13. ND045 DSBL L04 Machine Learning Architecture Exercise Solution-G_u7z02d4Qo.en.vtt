00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:07.270
For this exercise, you are helping a business understand the relative merits of

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:10.810
an in-house machine learning architecture as

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:14.500
opposed to a cloud-based machine learning architecture.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.755
You are asked to provide three benefits of

00:00:17.755 --> 00:00:22.835
each alternative in supportive data science initiatives in the production function.

00:00:22.835 --> 00:00:26.935
I'll share the benefits that I've identified with each alternative.

00:00:26.935 --> 00:00:32.135
Keep in mind that the benefits that you identified may differ from mine.

00:00:32.135 --> 00:00:35.114
When considering an in-house solution,

00:00:35.114 --> 00:00:38.620
one of the largest advantages is your ability to leverage

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.105
scale benefits for large storage and computing needs.

00:00:43.105 --> 00:00:45.925
If available, your company can leverage

00:00:45.925 --> 00:00:50.884
its own internal capabilities that can support the building, deployment,

00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:53.845
and maintenance of an in-house solution,

00:00:53.845 --> 00:01:00.485
rather than rely on sometimes costly managed services in cloud-based environments.

00:01:00.485 --> 00:01:05.530
An in-house solution also provides the best flexibility for the development of

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.990
novel models that are not available

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.995
through standard machine learning development libraries.

00:01:10.995 --> 00:01:14.095
Your architecture can be built to spec,

00:01:14.095 --> 00:01:18.090
customized precisely to the use cases at hand.

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.730
One of the primary advantages of a cloud-based architecture

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:25.410
is the ability to scale storage or compute on demand,

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:30.940
rather than add capital expense heavy hardware in order to meet a growing compute need,

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:36.440
a cloud-based architecture allows you to simply provision more powerful machines.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.340
A second advantage of cloud-based architecture is

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.060
the availability of managed services for needs such as security,

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.340
authentication, and so forth.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.600
For companies that do not have these specialized skills on staff,

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:56.360
cloud-based solutions provide an attractive alternative to hiring for these skills.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.705
Finally, cloud hosting solutions provide

00:01:59.705 --> 00:02:03.425
automated services for model monitoring and maintenance.

00:02:03.425 --> 00:02:07.650
The final key component of a machine-learning architecture.
