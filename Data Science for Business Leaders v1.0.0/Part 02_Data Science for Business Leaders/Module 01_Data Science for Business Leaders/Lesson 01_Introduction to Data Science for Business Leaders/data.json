I built the first Big Data team at Seagate and served as Chief Data Scientist for Sears and Kmart; I've also built teams for startups such as Nurx and Enveda Therapeutics.  I often keynote and present workshops on data sciences at conferences, and have written and published a book on implementing artificial intelligence, data science, and machine learning (_Artificial Intelligence: from Buzzword to Business Function._)  \n\nPrior to building my first data science team, I chaired a doctoral program in social science research methods as a faculty member at the University of Colorado, Boulder. I studied under some of the pioneers of machine learning during my doctoral studies at Stanford and also spent several years as a McKinsey management consultant in San Francisco. You can find me on LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/edwileyphd) and Twitter (**@WileyEd**), where I post often about data science and machine learning.\n\nI'm delighted to bring this course to you through Udacity. I hope you enjoy it!\n\nGood luck!",

              "text": "## History of Data Science Summary\n\nSome key milestones in the history of Data Science and AI:\n* During World War II, Alan Turing, a British computer scientist, deciphered the German “Enigma” code. \n* In 1940, science fiction writer Isaac Asimov published the first of a series of short stories that would eventually be collected in the 1950 book I, Robot, which postulated intelligent robots and the three rules of robotics. \n* In 1950, Turing set the bar for general artificial intelligence by proposing a computer that would be indistinguishable from a human player. This has become known as the Turing Test. \n* A machine called Ferranti Mark 1 mastered checkers in 1951. \n* In a paper for the 1956 Dartmouth Conference (the first artificial intelligence conference), John McCarthy created the term “Artificial Intelligence”. He also created the LISP programming language which for decades was the lingua franca of machine learning. \n*In 1956, AI researchers such as Marvin Minsky (who founded the AI Laboratory at MIT) focused on a “top-down” approach by programming computers with human behavioral rules. \n* In 1968, the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey featured HAL 9000, an intelligent computer. Marvin Minsky served as an advisor for the movie. \n* Shakey the Robot, which was the first general-purpose mobile robot, made its appearance in 1969. This robot could make decisions based on its perceptions of the surroundings. \n* In 1973, a period known as the “AI Winter” resulted from huge drops in funding because AI initiatives to date hadn’t lived up to expectations. \n* Research into narrow AI, also known as expert systems, started in 1981. These systems focused on providing solutions to specific tasks. Digital Equipment Corporation was among the companies that were successful at narrow AI systems. Successes such as these helped bring the end of the AI Winter. \n* In 1990, Rodney Brooks focused on a “bottom-up” approach to AI by laying the groundwork for the development of neural networks. \n* Later in the 1990s, the Japanese government supported an initiative to develop what they called a fifth-generation computer which used parallel computing to use concurrent logic programming for AI. \n* The Supercomputer Deep Blue (created by IBM) beat chess Grand Master Garry Kasparov in 1997. \n* The bursting of the dotcom bubble in the early 2000s brought a retreat in funding for AI.\n* In 2002, Roomba created the iRobot, an autonomous vacuum cleaner that learned the layout of the owner’s home. \n* The US military began investing in autonomous robots in 2004 and 2005. \n* In 2008, Google released a speech recognition application on the iPhone. \n* At the Shanghai 2010 World Expo, 20 NAO robots danced together. \n* IBM’s Watson emerged victorious over two of the world’s all-time best Jeopardy players in 2011. \n* In 2013, the idea of a robotic exoskeleton for soldiers – known as the Tactical Light Operator Suit (TALOS) – was proposed by the US Special Operations Command. Challenges such as dealing with the weight of power sources sufficient for the suit led the project to be shut down in 2019. \n* In 2014, the Eugene Goostman chatbot is reported to have passed the Turing Test. \n* In 2017, Google’s DeepMind AlphaGo defeated the world’s best Go champion. \n* In 2019, Google’s Alphastar defeated professional Starcraft II players with a score of 10-0. \n",

Therefore, a critical starting point for any data strategy is the articulation of a  business’s strategic objectives and identification of opportunities for data science-based transformation. \n* Lesson 3: Human Capital of Data Science: Managing Data Science Teams and Stakeholders\n\nThe human capital component of Data Science is critical to delivering on a data science strategy. This lesson will address:\n- Who do we recruit, hire, and train for our Data Science organization? \n- How is that organization structured in order to deliver value to our business? \n- How do our Data Scientists carry out their work in a structured manner? \n- How do we leverage data and data science to foster a data-driven culture throughout the business? \n* Lesson 4: Data and Machine Learning Infrastructure Strategy \n\n\n\nFinally, executing the Data Science strategy requires technology -- technology for data and technology for machine learning.  \n\nTechnology needs are specific to each business; \n- they depend on the types of data to be leveraged for Data Science \n- the form and magnitude of that data\n- the types of data science models that a business plans to create\n- the overall scale of operations represented by those data science models.  \n\nThe fourth lesson covers in great detail the parameters that must be considered both in creating a Data and Data Architecture Strategy and in building a Machine Learning Architecture to support Data Science initiatives.\n \n**Course Learning Objectives**\n\nUpon completion of this executive program, students will be able to:\n\n* Given a set of candidate data science projects, determine the relative strategic importance, cost, complexity of implementation, risk, the likelihood of value capture, and magnitude of benefit for each \n* Identify and prioritize the mix of roles they would pursue to build out a data science organization. \n* Prepare a detailed Data and Data Architecture strategy for their business (including the various roles of data consumers, data pipelines, and data sources)\n* Prepare a detailed Machine Learning Architecture strategy for their business.\n* Generate strategies for promoting a data-driven culture for their business.\n",
