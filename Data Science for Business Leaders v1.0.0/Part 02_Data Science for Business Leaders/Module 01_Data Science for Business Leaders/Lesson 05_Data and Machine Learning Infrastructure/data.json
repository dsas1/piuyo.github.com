For example, consider the case of a natural language processing-based message classifier. As customer inquiry messages come in, they may specifically address issues with specific product lines. If these messages can be automatically classified and routed to specialists particular to those lines, we can save a lot of time and provide better customer service. We run into a challenge when product lines change. If we train our model based on data from the first half of the year, and then in the second half of the year we launch a new product line, we shouldn't expect our model to be able to classify messages according to that new product line because it was never trained on messages associated with that product line. In this case, the training data is not representative of the data that is encountered by the model in production. \n\nThere are two particular forms of bias that may occur in training data:\n1. **Convenience bias.** Some types of data may be easier to collect than other types of data. If this more convenient data is not fully representative of the full variety of data that will be encountered in production, this can skew the data you have available in your ground truth data set, the one you use to train your model, which then skews your machine learning model. \n2. **Recency bias.** You may have gathered more data recently than in the past for some reason. This may be fine, unless that data is skewed for some reason, and does not represent the full variety of data that the machine learning model will encounter in the future. It is critically important to ensure that any machine learning model has been built on data that is most representative of how that model will be used in the future.\n\n### Key Terms:\n- **Training Data**: Subset of your data used to train the machine learning model.\n- **Testing Data**: Subset of your data held out from model training used to test model fit.\n- **Convenience bias**: Some types of data may be easier to collect than other types of data, thus skewing the data you have available in your ground truth dataset, and then skewing your ML model.\n- **Recency bias**: You may have gathered more data recently than in the past for some reason, and that recent data may be skewed for some reason, and not sufficiently represent the full variety of data that your ML model will encounter in the future.",

Seagate had specialized expertise in datacenter and cloud deployment, which made hosting internally a natural choice. \n\n**Cloud-hosted Architecture**: At companies that did not have such a level of skill, I have leveraged public cloud providers for hosting and deployment. I have personally worked with three of the top public cloud providers - Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Microsoft Azure.  Managed services, such as AWS Sagemaker, provide many of the data architecture, security, and monitoring services necessary for data and machine learning architecture management, providing an alternative well-suited for the organization that does not have the internal expertise to maintain its own solutions in-house. \n\n**Commercial Solutions**: For organizations with little development expertise, data science is still possible through commercial solutions such as Software as a Service or Machine Learning as a Service provider. For these companies, an off-the-shelf solution, such as those of Alteryx or SAS, is preferable to building and maintaining the infrastructure to support data science (either internally or via a public cloud). Commercial solutions provide ready-to-go functionality that essentially combines all three layers of the data science architecture. For companies wishing to start out with analytics with targeted analytics and machine learning use cases, who have data science or data analytic talent on hand but lack the data engineering and DevOps skills necessary to build, configure, maintain and support a data science architecture, a commercial alternative can provide a compelling way to access the benefits of data science.\n\n\n\n",

These must be matched to your use case; if you intend to deploy complex deep learning models, for example, you will need a great deal more computing power than if your models tend more toward parametric and tree-based alternatives. \n\nThe type of data you intend to use will determine your selection of data storage technology – whether that be in a data lake or in a relational or nonrelational data store. Cloud hosting provides elastic capabilities so that computing and storage can be scaled on-demand, a critical degree of flexibility for many companies whose data science workloads may be uneven or likely to change.\n\nFinally, cloud hosting solutions provide automated services for model monitoring and maintenance, the final key component of a machine learning architecture. \nMonitoring should focus particularly on whether model performance degrades over time, as ground truth data drifts from the training set on which the model was trained. Monitoring solutions allow the user to set predefined thresholds and scheduled procedures that identify model drift and trigger retraining and redeploying the model and can provide A/B testing capabilities to support the redeploy decision. Cloud monitoring and maintenance solutions typically integrate with appropriate notification technologies, such as SMS or Slack. ",

Alternatively, smaller budgets might favor cloud providers or more targeted commercial applications, since either avoids the need for large capital outlays required of in-house solutions.\n* **Internal technical skills**: Lower internal technical skills favor purchasing an external platform, since the organization’s existing team may not have the expertise to develop in-house. \n* **Maintenance budget**: A smaller long-term maintenance budget favors an external platform since most of the maintenance cost will be borne by the vendor.\n",

We noted that a critical starting point for any data strategy is the articulation of a business’s strategic objectives and identification of opportunities for data science-based transformation. \n\nWe discussed the human capital component of Data Science, which is critical to delivering on a data science strategy. We discussed recruiting, hiring, and training for our Data Science organization. We discussed organizational structure for the data science organization, and we learned how our Data Scientists carry out their work in a structured manner. We also discussed how to leverage data and data science to foster a data-driven culture throughout the business. \n\nFinally, we noted that executing the Data Science strategy requires technology for data and technology for machine learning.  Technology needs are specific to each business; they depend on the types of data to be leveraged for Data Science, the form and magnitude of that data, the types of data science models that a business plans to create, and the overall scale of operations represented by those data science models.  To that end, we discussed the parameters that must be considered both in creating a Data and Data Architecture Strategy and in building a Machine Learning Architecture to support Data Science initiatives.",
